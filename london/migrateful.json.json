  "description": "Migrateful helps refugees and asylum seekers on their journey to employment and independence and promotes integration. It runs cookery classes led by migrant chefs struggling to integrate and access employment due to legal and linguistic barriers. The cookery classes provide ideal conditions not just for learning English and building confidence, but also for promoting contact and cultural exchange with the wider community.\n\nWe train our chefs through weekly workshops, taking them on a journey from passionate home cook to confident cookery class teacher. When our chefs feel ready, they deliver evening cookery classes to paying customers. These paid classes take place in cafes, or customers can host a class in their own home for themselves and their friends. Since Migrateful was founded in July 2017, we have run 600 cookery classes with 6000 participants and now have 26 chefs from from 20 different countries.",
