This is a senior role, and as well as day-to-day product management you'll be expected to get involved more broadly, helping to define product strategy and to establish best practices in product development.\n\nYour role will include:\n\n- Developing a deep understanding of our customers and our business, and using that understanding to define future development of a number of our products.\n- Thoroughly researching proposed product ideas. \n- Developing those ideas which show promise, including overseeing the design process.\n- Maintaining a development backlog for the products you're responsible for, and providing enough detail for effective development.\n- Collaborating with the engineering team throughout the delivery process.\n- Overseeing the launch of new product features, validating their effectiveness and using the experience as a source of feedback for future product iterations.\n\nYou will also be expected to:\n\n- Support product strategy and longer term roadmapping, including preparation for communicating both of these to stakeholders across the business, Filtered's board, investors and customers.\n- Own the implementation of new product tools and practices, for example user testing and analytics frameworks.\n- Help define how Filtered approaches product in general.\n\nThis role reports in to the Chief Product Officer, and you'll collaborate closely with our existing product and engineering teams, as well as many stakeholders inside and outside the business.\n\nThe role is currently fully remote as a result of government policy, but Filtered is based in Shoreditch, London. We're remote friendly at all times.\n\n**Requirements**\n\nWe're looking for a particular approach to product management. In particular, we expect that:\n\n- You're customer oriented, and view speaking to customers and understanding them an their needs as key part of the role.\n- You'll be hypothesis driven, and take a scientific approach to product development. You view product ideas as hypotheses to be tested rather than simply a list of things to build.\n- You're data driven, but also understand the value of more qualitative evidence.\n- You're motivated to move quickly, for example, you realise that you can learn from a very basic initial implementation of a product feature, or from user research based on a mock-up. You're not afraid to get involved in the delivery process if that's necessary to help you achieve your goals.\n- You're commercially minded, and are comfortable working closely with the sales, marketing and customer success teams.\n\nWe don't require any specific qualifications for this role, but it is a senior position, so we expect you to have several years of high quality experience in focused product management roles. Experience working in a start-up, in a B2B environment selling to large enterprises or in the learning and development space would be a strong plus, but it not required.\n\n**Benefits**\n\nAs well as a competitive compensation package (based on skills and experience), we also offer flexible working, a generous pension scheme and 25 days holiday per year.\n\n",
