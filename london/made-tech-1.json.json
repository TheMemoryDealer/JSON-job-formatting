      "description": "***CORONAVIRUS UPDATE:*** Hiring at Made Tech continues as usual. Our team are now all working remotely so all interviews will be facilitated remotely too. Hopefully this will still be a good experience for candidates. (feedback welcome)\r\nWe're even setup to on-board any new starters remotely should we need to. All our projects are setup to continue remotely as well :)\r\n\r\n---------------------------\r\n\r\n*Salary range is ¬£75-100k per annum plus a range of excellent benefits. Apply below.*\r\n\r\nOur Senior Engineer 2s are Tech Leads, Architects, Thought Leaders, Full Stack Engineers, and Consultants. They are our most senior technologist within a customer account representing Made Tech and act as a hands-on CTO across one or more software delivery teams driving organisational change and outcomes for users. They combine technical excellence, drive to deliver, and coaching, to achieve outcomes for our customers and their users, and to establish strong engineering cultures within our customers organisations. They find themselves working on a variety of different problems from monoliths to microservices, upskilling colleagues and customers, always finding themselves learning from others, while constantly striving to be nice humans :)\r\n\r\n**What does the job entail?**\r\n\r\nWe primarily write and deliver custom software for the public sector. We work across central and local government, as well as in health, and our past lies in the technology startup world. Technical excellence for us isn‚Äôt about delivering to feature lists. We place a strong emphasis on outcome-based delivery; ensuring our customer‚Äôs goals are understood and achieved with the technology we deploy.\r\n\r\nDepending on our customers' needs our Senior 2s may play one or more roles. Sometimes the role is very hands-on and you'll be the most senior engineer on the team delivering software, other times you will play more of a technical architect advising teams and ensuring consistency across multiple deliveries. Further still you may play a strong part in account management and hold relationships with our customers senior staff as a technical adviser.\r\n\r\nWe need flexible individuals who enjoy a varied workload, are happy to switch between being more and less hands-on, but don't see themselves stepping away from code any time soon. It might be that you're stronger as a Tech Lead or as a Tech Architect, or only have experience in one area, that's okay as long as you have an interest and willingness to broaden your expertise.\r\n\r\nOur teams have used Ruby with Rails and Sinatra, ES6 with React and Angular 2, C# with .NET Core. We don‚Äôt limit ourselves as a company and we expect all our Engineers to be keen on learning new technologies. Automation is important to our teams, so we make sure there is a CD pipeline set up to build, test, and release many times per day.\r\n\r\nHigh performing software delivery teams need to be empowered to iteratively and rapidly deliver changes all the way through to production. To do this we combine our extensive cloud automation knowledge with DevOps culture.\r\n\r\nWe've been using AWS from the start and as Advanced Partners are go to experts within the public sector. We use a range of IaaS, PaaS and FaaS depending on the needs of our users, in this case software teams, such as EC2, Lambda, ECS, Kubernetes, Heroku, CloudFoundry, Azure App Services, and more. We use VPC and PrivateLink for connecting to on-premise, legacy systems. We also use API Gateway, S3, CloudFront, SQS, SNS, SES, RDS, and many other services provided by AWS.\r\n\r\nWe ensure we document our architecture and infrastructure as code, using technologies such as Terraform and OpenAPI. Containerisation is a big part of empowering our teams to develop, deploy and scale their applications, but so too is using AWS Lambda and avoiding the complexity of stateful services altogether. Right tool for the job.\r\n\r\nFor us, DevOps is about culture rather than roles and titles. Even though this role is for someone with strong DevOps experience, the biggest impact you will have is coaching and helping teams use the platforms you build. You won't be building infrastructure in isolation or charged with deploying other peoples work into production. You'll empower teams with the mantra: you build it, you run it!\r\n\r\nWe grow a team of polyglot programmers, which you might already consider yourself to be, who are versed in a mix of paradigms such as object-oriented, functional, declarative, event-based and aspect-oriented. To create this environment our Senior Engineers need to embrace sharing their knowledge and skills with others, and they need to keep an open mind ‚Äì we‚Äôd love to hear some examples of mentoring, coaching and growing team members. Maybe you will have written some blog posts about your discipline, or perhaps even delivered a talk or two.\r\n\r\n**Job requirements**\r\n\r\nWhat experience are we looking for?\r\nWhile we will look for you to have experience in these things, if you don‚Äôt have one of these don‚Äôt let that stop you applying.\r\n\r\nWorking directly with customers and users\r\nWorking within multidisciplinary teams with product, design, and technology working within the same cycles\r\nAgile practices such as Scrum, XP, and/or Kanban\r\nShowcasing and presentation skills\r\nWritten code with test-driven development\r\nWorked with many programming languages\r\nWorked with many databases\r\nWorked with APIs\r\nExperience in influencing architecture and teams\r\nDebugging experience in a range of systems\r\nEvidence of self-development ‚Äì we value keen learners\r\nDrive to deliver outcomes for users\r\nDesire to mentor others\r\nEmpathy and people skills\r\nOptional experience\r\nDon‚Äôt forget to mention any of the experience listed below.

Further still you may play a strong part in account management and hold relationships with our customers senior staff as a technical adviser.</p>\n\n<p>We need flexible individuals who enjoy a varied workload, are happy to switch between being more and less hands-on, but don&#39;t see themselves stepping away from code any time soon. It might be that you&#39;re stronger as a Tech Lead or as a Tech Architect, or only have experience in one area, that&#39;s okay as long as you have an interest and willingness to broaden your expertise.</p>\n\n<p>Our teams have used Ruby with Rails and Sinatra, ES6 with React and Angular 2, C# with .NET Core. We don‚Äôt limit ourselves as a company and we expect all our Engineers to be keen on learning new technologies. Automation is important to our teams, so we make sure there is a CD pipeline set up to build, test, and release many times per day.</p>\n\n<p>High performing software delivery teams need to be empowered to iteratively and rapidly deliver changes all the way through to production. To do this we combine our extensive cloud automation knowledge with DevOps culture.</p>\n\n<p>We&#39;ve been using AWS from the start and as Advanced Partners are go to experts within the public sector. We use a range of IaaS, PaaS and FaaS depending on the needs of our users, in this case software teams, such as EC2, Lambda, ECS, Kubernetes, Heroku, CloudFoundry, Azure App Services, and more. We use VPC and PrivateLink for connecting to on-premise, legacy systems. We also use API Gateway, S3, CloudFront, SQS, SNS, SES, RDS, and many other services provided by AWS.</p>\n\n<p>We ensure we document our architecture and infrastructure as code, using technologies such as Terraform and OpenAPI. Containerisation is a big part of empowering our teams to develop, deploy and scale their applications, but so too is using AWS Lambda and avoiding the complexity of stateful services altogether. Right tool for the job.</p>\n\n<p>For us, DevOps is about culture rather than roles and titles. Even though this role is for someone with strong DevOps experience, the biggest impact you will have is coaching and helping teams use the platforms you build. You won&#39;t be building infrastructure in isolation or charged with deploying other peoples work into production. You&#39;ll empower teams with the mantra: you build it, you run it!</p>\n\n<p>We grow a team of polyglot programmers, which you might already consider yourself to be, who are versed in a mix of paradigms such as object-oriented, functional, declarative, event-based and aspect-oriented. To create this environment our Senior Engineers need to embrace sharing their knowledge and skills with others, and they need to keep an open mind ‚Äì we‚Äôd love to hear some examples of mentoring, coaching and growing team members. Maybe you will have written some blog posts about your discipline, or perhaps even delivered a talk or two.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Job requirements</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>What experience are we looking for?</strong><br>\nWhile we will look for you to have experience in these things, if you don‚Äôt have one of these don‚Äôt let that stop you applying.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Working directly with customers and users</li>\n<li>Working within multidisciplinary teams with product, design, and technology working within the same cycles</li>\n<li>Agile practices such as Scrum, XP, and/or Kanban</li>\n<li>Showcasing and presentation skills</li>\n<li>Written code with test-driven development</li>\n<li>Worked with many programming languages</li>\n<li>Worked with many databases</li>\n<li>Worked with APIs</li>\n<li>Experience in influencing architecture and teams</li>\n<li>Debugging experience in a range of systems</li>\n<li>Evidence of self-development ‚Äì we value keen learners</li>\n<li>Drive to deliver outcomes for users</li>\n<li>Desire to mentor others</li>\n<li>Empathy and people skills</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Optional experience</strong><br>\nDon‚Äôt forget to mention any of the experience listed below.
