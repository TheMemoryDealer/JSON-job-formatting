  "description": "Factmata's vision is to help empower the world to better understand what is going on in online content.\n\nWe are building a number of customer-facing SaaS products for businesses who lack the tools to understand online media content for things not possible before, including bias, leaning and threatful-ness, for the purposes of moderation, intelligence and insights. Factmata's engine for language classification and understanding has applications for investment research, hedge fund trading, programmatic advertising, search engines and more. \n\nFactmata has a vision to use its proprietary Factmata content understanding engine to build a media platform for sharing, questioning, curating and responding to online content, targeted at domain experts and news enthusiasts, focused on the quality and credibility of content rather than how many 'likes' it gets.
