  "slogan": "Fintech company fixing the R&D tax relief sector",
  "description": "We believe the R&D tax relief sector is totally broken - submitting claims is a nightmare. Traditional consultancies are slow, time-consuming, and expensive.\n\nClaimer's platform makes it really easy, quick, and cheap for any company to judge their eligibility and submit R&D tax relief claims. It guides you the whole way, and connects to your accounting software to pull out the right numbers. Once we have the information, our experts then check, enhance, and submit the claim on the company's behalf. \n\nSmall claims can be completed in just 20 minutes for just 5% of what you get back. No multi-year contracts or upfront payment required. It couldn't be easier, and with a 100% success rate, and tens of thousands saved in fees, our customers are loving the product.\n\nWe're a rocket ship taking off, join our team and be part of the revolution!",
