  "description": "Koru Kids (www.korukids.co.uk) is on a mission to improve childcare in London. It's desperately needed. Did you know that most families with children spend as much on childcare as they do on their mortgage? Or that the average cost of a nanny in Central London is £37,000? Did you know that nurseries aren't much cheaper than that, if you have two children? Did you know that many nurseries shut for summer holidays, and that if your child is sick they can't go for the next 48 hrs?  If you're a parent, you probably knew all of that and more.\n\nKoru Kids will solve these problems, starting with nanny share. We have 1500 families on our platform, and recently concluded a 3x oversubscribed funding round. \n\nTo find out more, check out \nLinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/in/rachel-carrell-30ab79/\nITV news: youtu.be/5VdhnKE77Ek \nEvening Standard: http://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/london-life/airbnbstyle-childcare-service-koru-kids-could-be-the-solution-for-working-london-parents-a3450191.html ",

We’re making it easier and more affordable for families to access high quality childcare. If you want the opportunity to do irreplaceable work on a unique problem alongside people that will challenge & inspire you; keep reading.\n\n \n\n**About the role**\n\nAs Business Intelligence Lead, you’ll be instrumental in helping us achieve our mission of profoundly improving the wellbeing of one million families in London within 5 years.\n\nCo-leading our Product Insights team with our Lead User Researcher, this team will be tasked with 3 things:\n\n \n\n1. Help us understand which problems are the most important ones to solve \n2. Help us determine whether the things that we build are having the impact we think they’re having\n3. Help us figure out how we democratise 1 & 2 to make product insight self service\n\n \n\nAs an expert in quantitative research, business intelligence and data architecture, you’ll build processes, tools and expertise to help better understand the above. This role isn’t just a query writer and dashboard builder, we’ll be relying on you to help shape the trajectory of the organisation and ensure we truly build the world’s best childcare service.\n\n \n\n**About the team**\n\nWe have a transparent and kind team culture, and are truly mission-driven. We care very much about helping families flourish. We’re committed to working with integrity, doing the right thing and building a company we are truly proud of. We’re growing super fast but we also want to make sure that we are building a company on really solid foundations.\n\n \n\n**About you**\n\nAn exceptionally strong critical thinker, you can rationally prioritise which problems to solve as well as discover how to solve them. You have a strong user focus and passion for user-centred design, and consistently put both users and data before your ego. You understand the balance between being data validated vs data driven. You obsess about how to drive greater positive impact, and maintain clear performance metrics and dashboards. You can show how you set targets and tracked progress against them in transparent, measurable ways.\n\nYou love using quantitative analysis to shape product development and influence overall strategy. You’ll be happy communicating and partnering closely with senior stakeholders, the leadership team and Product leads on strategy; as well as getting in the weeds running your own SQL queries.\n\nYou have lots to teach others about the value of quantitative research & analysis, and are equally willing to learn from those around you. Emotionally intelligent, you welcome and give honest feedback, especially when it’s hard to do.\n\n \n\nYou’ll have blown our socks off if, in your first 6 months, all teams feel like they have the quant data they need; 95% of releases have empirical, quantitative measures of success; we feel more confident about the longer term strategy; and everyone who wants to get access to quant data says they feel like they’re able to self serve for 50% of their requirements.\n\n \n\n**Must have knowledge/experience:**\n\n- Lots of experience in an analytical role using SQL, Python, or R working on an analytics, data science or product team, building and automating reporting dashboards, spreadsheet, and presentation tools\n- Experience with advanced relational database techniques, ideally on large transactional (not reporting) databases\n- Experience managing and/or leading quantitative teams\n- Experience collaborating with qualitative User Researchers\n- Track record of successful project management, execution, multi-tasking, delegating, and collaborating with cross-functional teams to set goals and lead through vision, clarity, and passion\n\n**Must have skills:**\n\n- Ability to synthesize data into useful formats to drive actionable insights for Product and Operations teams\n- Ability to get things done and work independently.\n- Ability to understand and contribute to a long-term strategic vision\n- Excellent interpersonal, communication, negotiation, and collaboration skills\n- Effective data analysis skills in a business context, with the ability to present large datasets in a clear and compelling manner\n- Excellent analytical, strategic thinking, and creative problem-solving skills\n- Construct analyses around a specific business question, write a clear, usable project plan, and execute with minimal guidance\n- Be a thought leader on how to use data to inform the product experience with executive leadership\n- *Experience with designing data architecture and warehousing*\n\n**Must have behaviours:**\n\n- You must be nice\n- You must be authentic.  We want you to be you, not the “work” version of you\n- You must be entrepreneurial. You won’t need a lot of direction. You’re a [Manager of One](https://workable.com/nr?l=https%3A%2F%2Fsignalvnoise.com%2Fposts%2F1430-hire-managers-of-one)\n- You must have the desire to look for simpler but better solutions and the ability to do more with less\n- You must have an analytical mind that uses empirical data as well as opinions to back up your position\n- You must have huge passion & belief in your own ideas, and the humility to embrace being wrong  \n\n \n\nIf we had to sum up your profile in three words, they’d be “Smart, Kind, Creative”\n\nIf you’re interested, send us your CV.  Alternatively, send us something else that demonstrates your literary prowess, technical capability, creativity or belief in our cause. Impress us; stand out.\n\n",

Emotionally intelligent, you welcome and give honest feedback, especially when it’s hard to do.</p>\n\n<p>You’ll have blown our socks off if, in your first 6 months, all teams feel like they have the quant data they need; 95% of releases have empirical, quantitative measures of success; we feel more confident about the longer term strategy; and everyone who wants to get access to quant data says they feel like they’re able to self serve for 50% of their requirements.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Must have knowledge/experience:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Lots of experience in an analytical role using SQL, Python, or R working on an analytics, data science or product team, building and automating reporting dashboards, spreadsheet, and presentation tools</li>\n<li>Experience with advanced relational database techniques, ideally on large transactional (not reporting) databases</li>\n<li>Experience managing and/or leading quantitative teams</li>\n<li>Experience collaborating with qualitative User Researchers</li>\n<li>Track record of successful project management, execution, multi-tasking, delegating, and collaborating with cross-functional teams to set goals and lead through vision, clarity, and passion</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Must have skills:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Ability to synthesize data into useful formats to drive actionable insights for Product and Operations teams</li>\n<li>Ability to get things done and work independently.</li>\n<li>Ability to understand and contribute to a long-term strategic vision</li>\n<li>Excellent interpersonal, communication, negotiation, and collaboration skills</li>\n<li>Effective data analysis skills in a business context, with the ability to present large datasets in a clear and compelling manner</li>\n<li>Excellent analytical, strategic thinking, and creative problem-solving skills</li>\n<li>Construct analyses around a specific business question, write a clear, usable project plan, and execute with minimal guidance</li>\n<li>Be a thought leader on how to use data to inform the product experience with executive leadership</li>\n<li><em>Experience with designing data architecture and warehousing</em></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Must have behaviours:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>You must be nice</li>\n<li>You must be authentic.  We want you to be you, not the “work” version of you</li>\n<li>You must be entrepreneurial. You won’t need a lot of direction. You’re a <a href=\"https://workable.com/nr?l=https%3A%2F%2Fsignalvnoise.com%2Fposts%2F1430-hire-managers-of-one\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Manager of One</a></li>\n<li>You must have the desire to look for simpler but better solutions and the ability to do more with less</li>\n<li>You must have an analytical mind that uses empirical data as well as opinions to back up your position</li>\n<li>You must have huge passion &amp; belief in your own ideas, and the humility to embrace being wrong<br></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If we had to sum up your profile in three words, they’d be “Smart, Kind, Creative”</p>\n\n<p>If you’re interested, send us your CV.

We’re on a mission to improve childcare in London, and looking for someone experienced, creative and friendly to join our* *team.*\n\n### About Koru Kids\n\nKoru Kids is on a mission to improve childcare in London, making it easier and more affordable for families to access flexible and high quality childcare. We are backed by fantastic investors, including top VCs who’ve backed companies like Wonderbly, Thread and Appear Here, as well as the founders of Gumtree and Entrepreneur First. We won ‘Best Technology’ at the Business Women Awards 2017, and are currently shortlisted for a number of awards including Startups ‘Tech Business of the Year’.\n\n### About the role\n\nWe’re building a marketplace that enables families to find and share high quality nannies. As an engineer on the Koru Kids team, you’ll be designing and building tech to make complex matching problems a breeze, to give families and nannies a solution that just works, and to supercharge our nanny recruitment and training processes.\n\nYou’ll be working in  **Ruby**  for most of the backend, with  **Rails** ,  **PostgreSQL**  and  **Redis**  making up the majority of our core product. You’ll be using modern frontend tooling, with  **ES6, React**  and  **Tachyons**. When it comes to shipping code, you’ll be sending pull requests and doing code reviews in  **GitHub** , and checking that  **CircleCI**  is happy before anything goes live. You’ll mostly be deploying to  **Heroku** , with some heavy lifting on  **AWS**. (That said, our priority is making sure we’re using the right tools for the job and we’re open to adding to or changing up our tech and tooling as appropriate.)\n\nWe’re continuously improving our product, building key features that will move the needle in a big way. Instead of an endless product roadmap, we run short development cycles to test assumptions and make smart decisions quickly. We favour feature flags over staging environments and deploy to production as often as we need to; deployment cycles shouldn’t get in the way of delivering value. As an engineer on the team, you’ll work closely with product and operations to find and build creative solutions for business problems and make sure we’re delivering the most value to our customers.\n\n### About you\n\nYou’re a mid-level or experienced generalist or backend web developer who thrives in small, fast-moving engineering teams.\n\n**Essential**\n\n- Familiarity with web application development\n- Familiarity with relational databases and SQL\n- You take pride in writing readable, well-designed and well-tested software\n- You’re keen to pair program when appropriate, and generally enjoy a culture of code review\n- You’re humble, you lap up feedback, and you want to learn\n- You roll with it. You understand that startups are unpredictable environments, and are comfortable with a degree of chaos\n- You own it. You take responsibility for your work from start to finish\n\n**Not essential, but nice to have**\n\n- Experience with Ruby on Rails\n\n- Familiarity with front-end development, including modern JavaScript frameworks and tooling e.g React.\n\n- You practice test-driven development\n\n**Any of these profiles could be a great fit**\n\n- Developer bootcamp graduate with at least one year of software engineering experience in industry\n- New graduate in Computer Science or related field and a couple of software engineering internships\n- Experienced software engineer with a number of years in industry\n\n### Our interview process\n\n- Initial telephone conversation with a member of the team\n\n- Take home coding exercise (1 - 2 hours)\n\n- On site interview involving pairing on the coding exercise and meeting several other members of the team\n\n",
