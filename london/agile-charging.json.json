  "slogan": "Fast EV charging, anywhere",
  "description": "By connecting our chargepoint to standard 16A Commando sockets and trickle charging 20kWh of lithium-ion batteries overnight, the chargepoint can provide 2x 7kW fast charges via 2x Type 2 connectors on sites that could not otherwise provide this.\n\nThe chargepoint removes the need for costly installation work and the lengthy-time delays required by upgrading your site's power supply.\n\nThe device is web-enabled and OCPP 2.0 compliant, meaning we can integrate with your preferred 3rd party EV software. The chargepoint is also smart charging-enabled and can be integrated with your site's existing demand response fleet if required.",
