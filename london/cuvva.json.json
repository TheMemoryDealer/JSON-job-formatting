  "description": "Cuvva is building a new kind of insurance that's flexible, simple and jargon-free. The insurance startup sold its first policy in 2016. Since then, the mobile app has sold over one million policies. \n\nThe idea came about after co-founder, Freddy Macnamara, couldn't get hourly short-term insurance, so he set out to build a marketplace for flexible insurance. Cuvva connects customers directly with insurers, providing comprehensive cover within minutes, and 24/7 customer support. Pioneering short-term insurance, Cuvva was the first to provide both hourly motor insurance and insurance via an app in the UK. \n\nCuvva has expanded to offer personal car, learners, van, taxi, and travel insurance.\n\nShaping clear and fair insurance has led Cuvva to get funding from leading investors, including LocalGlobe, Seepcamp, Techstars, Tekton and Breega.",

You care deeply about building rock-solid infrastructure for the long term, with a track record of delivering solutions which support your team and your product.</p>\n\n<p>You will develop Cuvva&#39;s core platform, abstracting the key processes required to sell insurance, delivering solutions that allow the team to develop strong and stable products, without having to spend time ensuring they get the basics right.</p>\n\n<p>Aside from developing core platform services, we expect you will also become heavily involved with ops and security activities, contributing towards the maintenance of our servers, AWS account, etc.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Core platform&quot;</p>\n\n<p>When we refer to the &quot;core platform&quot;, we mean the services which underpin the processes of all insurance activities on our system.</p>\n\n<p>For example, we expect one of these to be the &quot;policy service&quot;, which might be responsible for ensuring compliant issuance of policies, coordinating mid-term adjustments, preventing overlapping policies (double insurance), etc.</p>\n\n<p>Other services could include user authentication, risk &amp; pricing calculation, handling the process of modifying user data in-line with any mid-term adjustment requirements.</p>\n\n<p>All services we consider to be part of the core platform will have strict requirements around stability, data integrity and transactional safety. All functionality must fail safely and explicitly, for example using 2-phase commit processes or other similar techniques. This will also require a reasonable level of testing to validate this safety.</p>\n\n<p>Requirements</p>\n\n<p>The perfect addition to our team will have:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>a fiercely independent and self-driven approach</li>\n<li>5+ years&#39; commercial experience working on back-end systems at high-scale startups</li>\n<li>at least a year of commercial experience working with Go</li>\n<li>strong knowledge of security practices, ideally with a slightly grey-hat background</li>\n<li>a working knowledge of the entire web stack - from how DNS lookups are transmitted, to how browsers prioritize CSS rules</li>\n<li>awareness of compliance and financial regulation</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>We are a small team so it is important that the successful candidate is not only technically highly competent, but also a great cultural fit!</p>\n\n<p>Equality</p>\n\n<p>We‚Äôre committed to ensuring that everyone has a fair chance to join Cuvva, whatever your background. We will always treat your application in a fair and equal manner.</p>\n\n<p>Benefits</p>\n\n<p>As well as a competitive salary (¬£60-75k, dependent on experience) and equity based remuneration, benefits of working at Cuvva include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Working in our (dog friendly üêï‚ù§Ô∏è) offices in Shoreditch</li>\n<li>Monthly team outings (karaoke, go-karting, bowling, comedy night!)</li>\n<li>Regular team lunches</li>\n<li>Health and wellbeing allowance</li>\n<li>Professional development allowance</li>\n<li>Brand new MacBook</li>\n<li>Cycle to work scheme</li>\n<li>Travel season ticket loan</li>\n<li>Book club &amp; Breakfast club</li>\n<li>Annual day off for volunteering</li>\n<li>33 days of holiday a year (inc.
