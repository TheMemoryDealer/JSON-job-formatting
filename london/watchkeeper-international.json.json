  "description": "WatchKeeper is redefining incident monitoring and response, giving security managers the most comprehensive  global view of  risks facing their organisation.\n​\nThe platform connects internal real-estate, HR, travel bookings, access control, CCTV and other network-connected systems, giving security managers and crisis responders complete domain awareness of their assets and personnel globally. \n \nLive mapping of third party risk layers, such as social media, political risk analysis and natural disaster feeds, can generate real-time alerts, notifying security managers of incidents that could threaten the safety of employees or impact business operations.  \n \nDashboard metrics give instantaneous key metrics on facilities and employees in the impacted area, and integration with mass notification systems ensures rapid staff accounting and efficient business continuity. \n \nWatchKeeper is redefining how corporate security managers identify and manage risks to their organisations.",
