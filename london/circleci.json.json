In this role, you will challenge and support our teams with the individual in mind, and build a great culture with diversity, inclusion, action orientation, and openness as some of [our core values](https://circleci.com/careers/). \n\nAs one of our Senior Engineering Managers, you will work across our entire Engineering organization (Product- and Platform Engineering) to support teams, managers, and drive larger organizational initiatives. You will initially start out in this role by supporting and building out our Growth teams, and take on additional responsibilities as our organization evolves. \n\nThis is a full-time role in Canada, hired through our affiliate Continuous Labs .\n\n**What You’ll Do: **\n\nThis role is a people management role focused on the development of engineers and delivery of business value. Your recurring tasks and responsibilities include:\n\n- **Business value delivery:** Ensure continuous, incremental business value delivery and high-quality standards for your teams and help them utilize best practices to set and achieve their goals. Maintain high levels of transparency and efficiency, in collaboration with other development teams and Product Owners. Develop strategies and goals for your teams and the department in collaboration with our Product and Engineering leaders.\n- **Learning and Development:** Attract, onboard, and retain diverse top talent. Develop the teams and people in your domain through coaching, mentoring, and management support. Conduct regular 1:1s (including skip-level), goal setting, and feedback conversations with engineering managers and engineers to ensure their well-being and team health, and support them in their learning and development. Continuously work to improve inclusion and belonging on your teams and throughout our organization.\n- **Organizational work:** Help us continuously improve and grow and build further support structures for our teams by driving broader organizational development and cross-cutting initiatives with the rest of our engineering management team. \n- **Technical work:** Provide technical vision to your teams. Help grow the expertise of your team’s performance, reliability, resilience, scalability, maintainable architecture, and experimentation. We don’t expect you to write or review code on a regular basis, so this role may not be for you if you will deeply miss those things. \n\n### **What we're looking for:**\n\n- **At least five years of direct management experience** building and leading software development or operations teams. Your experience includes hiring, as well as having both engineers and managers directly reporting to you and supporting them in their growth. You’ve supported managers directly for at least four years.\n- At least 6 months of full-time experience working transparently and collaboratively with **distributed teams**.\n- A **track record of using agile and lean methodologies** to help teams continuously deliver business value. \n- Exceptional **written and verbal communication skills** honed for both synchronous and asynchronous collaboration, and strong feedback skills. You are a **service-oriented leader** and strong collaborator, and you know what it takes to build strong, inclusive, productive teams and how to support managers effectively to help them grow. \n- You’re **comfortable with ambiguity** and turning it into just enough structure to call it a process (and evolving it further from there). You’ve scaled people and systems from non-existent to acceptable to scalable. You bring action orientation and a drive to continuously improve the teams you work with.\n\n### **Who you’ll work with in this role: **\n\n- Your peers and “first team” are our Senior Engineering Managers, and you’re a part of our distributed engineering management team. Your direct reports are Engineering Managers and Architects. \n- You report to our VP of Product Engineering and work very closely with our VP Platform, VP Growth, as well as with the Product Managers supporting the teams in your domain. \n\n### **Distributed teams at CircleCI**\n\nWe’re a distributed company with offices in San Francisco, Toronto, Japan, and teammates across the world. For this position, we are specifically looking for a manager in Canada, ideally Toronto. \n\n### **How we hire Engineering Managers**\n\nOver the last year, we have made some critical shifts in our understanding of what we believe makes a great engineering manager at CircleCI, and learned a lot about our needs and values as an organization along the way.
