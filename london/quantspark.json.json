We apply commercial creativity and analytical rigour to tackle our clients' trickiest problems by combining strategic commercial acumen with the power of data science and bespoke product development.\n\n\nAs a BI Analyst at QuantSpark, you will be joining a team of driven, entrepreneurial, and intellectually-curious analysts who are laser-focused on providing commercial impact. We're a small but super-effective team so in particular we look out for Analysts who have entrepreneurial flair, attention to detail and an ability to understand what's important for our clients to succeed.\n\n\nWe are looking for a BI Analyst to join our Private Equity practice and work with a diverse range of portfolio companies to build out their data analytics capability. You will gain exposure to a vast range of different businesses and sectors – recent clients include The Foundry (responsible for the software behind almost all Special Effects Oscar winning movies!), IRIS (a billion-pound SaaS business) and Aqua Lung (the inventor and now world leading manufacturer of Scuba Diving apparatus).\n\n\nAs a BI Analyst you will help deliver BI projects end-to-end, from data extraction, engineering and modelling through to visualisation, regular reporting, and dashboard creation. Solutions vary from developing custom-built BI tools to leveraging existing products in the market such as PowerBI, Tableau, and Alteryx. We like to involve our Analysts as much as possible, so expect to meet and get to know senior client stakeholders during the projects (both from the portfolio company and the PE fund). The outputs of our BI projects typically have two highly impactful outputs; 1) as a source of day-to-day insight for senior management to guide the company’s performance, and 2) for the PE find to share with investors as an ‘interactive pitch-book’ during the investment exit process.\n\n\nWe welcome applications from anyone with a flair for super-powering decisions with data and an ambition to have practical impact. We're looking for people with a creative and robust approach to data engineering, data visualisation and problem solving.\n\nRequirements\n\nSo who are we looking for? You will have a range of analytical, commercial, and inter-personal qualities including:\n\n- Analytical ability - understanding data and transforming this into insight\n- Technical creativity - many of the solutions our clients require intellectual dexterity\n- Grit - some of our work is tough and requires a can-do attitude\n- Desire to learn - our work is innovative and so our team needs to sustain its sense of curiosity and desire to master new techniques\n- Communication - we require articulate individuals who are able to understand complex information and distil this for non-technical audiences\n\n\nEssential:\n\n- Advanced skills in SQL\n\n- Advanced skills in both PowerBI and Tableau\n\n- Experience with database structures and engineering\n\n- Understanding of SQL technologies such as: MySQL / MariaDB, Hive / Impala SQL, SparkSQL, NoSQL, Postgres SQL Server\n\n- Strong MS Excel skills, with VBA being a plus\n\n- Experience with Alteryx\n\n\nDesirable:\n\n- Interest in potentially applying R and Python\n\n- Experience of product development and desire to learn more\n\n- Experience in strategy consultancy or in an in-house strategy position\n\n- GIS technologies including: QGIS, ArcGIS, Google Maps APIs\n\n- Agile experience, product design, product management\n\n- Understanding of machine learning approaches\n\nBenefits\n\n* £30-45k salary (based on experience)\n* Monthly training & conference budget\n* 25 days holiday, plus Bank Holidays\n* Pension contribution scheme\n* Cycle to work scheme\n* Social impact / pro bono data science and development projects\n* Top-notch kit with high-end Macs standard for everyone\n* Monthly socials and dinner\n\n\nLocation: Farringdon, London (though you may have to work at clients' offices from time to time including outside of the UK)\n\nWe are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company.
