  "description": "AirGrid is building the next generation of artificial intelligence technology to help keep the web running. We are all used to a free internet with a diverse set of services and content, but without a sustainable way for creators to monetise their work we will be left with only a few portals, run by large corporations.\n\nOur first step in a better internet is to build an analytics platform which connects marketers to publishers, to ensure investment in great content creators continues - whilst allowing both parties to grow efficiencies in their business.",
