  "slogan": "Artificially intelligent candidate engagement platform",
  "description": "The platform helps candidates to become more familiar with potential employers by talking directly to company employees in a forum. This also allows the organisation to credibly gain control of their employer brand, which results in more engaged, better-matched applicants. Organisations worldwide, and across 10+ sectors, use the platform, including universities, whose students engage with applicants in order to attract them.\n\nOur clients range from SME-sized law firms and fledgling startups to multinational corporations and banking institutions like Santander and Citi - the platform scales with the size and needs of our clients, so there's no such thing as too small or too big. \n\nThe platform features a social media tool to help talent teams share the stories that their employees are telling in discussion threads, SEO tools to help boost the careers page's relevance in searches, and Live Chats so candidates can talk to a company's Insiders in real time.",
