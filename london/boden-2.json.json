  "description": "In 1991, eight just-right shirts went from Johnnie Boden’s kitchen table and out into the wider world. We’ve now outgrown Johnnie’s kitchen and are based at the significantly larger Boden House, in glamour-lite North Acton (that’s in West London in case it’s not on your radar). Plus, we’ve got a gigantic warehouse in Leicester, an American office in a trendy part of Boston. Altogether, more than 1000 of us create clothes that are timeless and tasteful, British and bold. Not only are we the recipients of a 30% staff discount, subsidised gym and a generous clothing allowance, but we start each day with free tea, coffee and toast. Perks are all well and good, but Boden is also a brand that values committed and creative thinkers and wants to help develop their skills. \nThe results are impressive; we’re a business with a turnover of £250 million (and growing), more than 1.7 million customers worldwide and our staff are happy and motivated. The winning formula? Fun + Style = Joy.",
