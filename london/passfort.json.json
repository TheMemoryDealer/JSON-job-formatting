  "slogan": "Enabling businesses & individuals to establish trust online",
  "description": "\nAt PassFort, we share a powerful vision to enable businesses & individuals to establish trust online. We do this by offering an Intelligent Risk Management (IRM) platform, giving small-to-medium sized financial services companies the ability to manage regulation and risk in real-time. \n\nOur platform is designed to digitise, automate and streamline processes across all customer onboarding, compliance and audit activity. By better serving the needs of back office teams (whilst integrating with existing CRM systems used by front office teams) our clients save time and money, reduce complexity and improve customer satisfaction.\n\nWe're transforming how trust is established online, in the same way that Salesforce transformed sales, Stripe transformed payments and AWS transformed DevOps.\n\n\n\n\n",
