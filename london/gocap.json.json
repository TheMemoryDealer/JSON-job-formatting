  "slogan": "Revolutionising Personal Lending",
  "description": "There are two main mismatches in the market of personal lending:\n1.     loans are either unproportionally  expensive, considering the global low-interest environment; or\n2.     very complex and timely to attain. \n \nThe tendency of the low cost of money for ‘classic’ loan providers not being passed on to borrowers, is due to inadequate and expensive risk assessment technique for individuals. The complexity surrounding personal loans is due to the lack of automatisation of the process. Both mismatches lead to inefficient and highly under-utilised markets.\n \nThe first problem is tackled by GOCAP forecasting future income potential. Usually, loan payments are not adjusted to household income, where loans can be serviced to a higher degree in time when salary or other sources of income rise. Loan providers use a snapshot in time to determine the terms. GOCAP will determine past, present and future to structure the product as a long-term loan with the payable interest being the higher of a low fixed interest and a percentage contribution of income. The company will therefore, be able to offer more affordable loans in the initial stage, than competitors and starts to monetise once the borrower reaches higher income levels.\n \nThe second problem is solved by automating the entire lending and assessment process. A machine learning predictive model is used to quickly provide fair and individualised terms based on data points provided by the customer. The money will reach the customer within hours compared to sometimes weeks as it is the case with banks.",
