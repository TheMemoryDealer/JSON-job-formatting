We’ve started off by redefining how to vet builders, systemising the process of obtaining quotations and simplified cost reviewing. Today, hundreds of construction professionals are dependent on us, allowing them to get back to doing what they do best.\n\nWhat’s next? Backed by venture capital, we’re growing quickly and need to create something special so that the market at large can enter the digital age. We’re off to a strong start, but we have a lot of work to do. Sound like your kind of challenge? We’d love to hear from you!",
