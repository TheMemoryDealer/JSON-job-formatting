You will be joining one of 3 teams that develop new features and improve existing parts of  Data Science Studio (DSS) based on user feedback.\n\nDSS is an on-premises application that connects together all big data technologies. We work with SQL databases, Spark, Kubernetes, Hadoop, Elasticsearch, MLlib, scikit-learn, Shiny, … and many more. Basically, our technological stack is made of all the technologies present in Technoslavia!\n\nOur backend is mainly written in Java but also includes large chunks in Scala, Python and R. Our frontend is based on Angular and also makes vast usage of d3.js.\n\nOne of the most unique characteristics of DSS is the breadth of its scope and the fact that it caters both to data analysts (with visual and easy to use analytics) and data scientists (with deep integration in code and libraries, and a web-based IDE).\n\nThis is a full-time position, based in France either in our Paris office or remote.\n\n\nYour missions\n- Turn ideas or simplistic specifications into full-fledged product features, including unit and end-to-end tests.\n- Tackle complex problems that range from performance and scalability to usability, so that complicated machineries look straightforward and simple to use for our users.\n- Help your coworkers: review code, spread your technical expertise, improve our tool chain\n- Bring your energy to the team!\n\n\nYou are the ideal recruit if\n- You are mastering a programming language (Java, C#, Python, Javascript, You-name-it, ...).\n- You know that low-level Java code and slick web applications in Javascript are two sides of the same coin and are eager to use both.\n- You know that ACID is not a chemistry term.\n- You have a first experience (either professional or personal) building a real product or working with big data or cloud technologies.\n\n\nHiring process\n- Initial call with the talent acquisition manager\n- On-site meeting (or video call) with the hiring manager\n- Home test to show your skills\n- Final on-site interviews\n\n\n\n\n\nTo fulfill its mission, Dataiku is growing fast!
