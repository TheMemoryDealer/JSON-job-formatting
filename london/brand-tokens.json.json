  "description": "Brand Tokens platform allows for issuing brand loyalty tokens on the Blockchain. Unlike loyalty points, tokens are valued in real-time and can be traded and transferred between users. Brands can reward their clients with their own tokens, just like with points, users can redeem them for discount, products and services of the issuer or any other partner of the platform. Tokens also enable users to exchange them for cryptocurrencies or fiat if they wish. \n\nBrands can use their tokens to acquire new customers or reward loyal clients for purchases, for engagement in social media, participation in events or sharing their personal data, etc.",
