  "description": "Quantico is a new type of financial service for startups and entrepreneurs. We provide all the benefits of in-house finance teams, without the cost or effort of hiring.  At the core of our service is a guarantee to provide a fixed number of days a month of working directly in our clients’ offices.  Unlike outsourced accountants, this enables us to work collaboratively across the business and to take work off the founders’ plates, without having to agree to separate scopes of work.\n\nWe’re a decentralised firm, which means that all of our bookkeepers and the majority of our Accountants and Finance Directors are remote freelancers. Our clients come to us because they need access to a range of skill-sets, able to start almost immediately.\n\n",
