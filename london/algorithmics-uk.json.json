  "description": "Programming is a skill of the 21st century. Even though many schools teach information and communication technology, lots of students still have minimal elementary programming skills.\nAlgorithmics combines offline and online learning in programming classes for children from 8 to 15 years old. Our team consists of professionals who love children and want to make programming simple, exciting and fun for them. At Algorithmics, we help children take their first steps in STEM. Our students create video games, cartoons and IT projects. They acquire skills in critical thinking and logical reasoning, presentation and project planning, teamwork and more. No matter who they grow up to be, these children will take advantage of what they learn with us.",
