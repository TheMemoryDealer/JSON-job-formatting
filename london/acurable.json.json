  "description": "Acurable ( http://acurable.com ) is a high growth MedTech start-up headquartered in London. We commercialise the first wearable medical device able to accurately diagnose and manage respiratory conditions in a non-invasive way. Our award-winning patented technology is a major engineering innovation and the product of 10 years research at Imperial College London.\n\n* Accurate : 5x more accurate readings than current solutions, enabling automated diagnosis and drastically reducing misdiagnosis. \n* Easy to use : non-invasive and no training required, enabling home use without the assistance of a specialist or a visit to the hospital, which significantly lowers overall costs.\n\nWe aim to understand human biosignals so well that nobody dies of a treatable condition ever again. To achieve our objectives, we are building a team of exceptional people who are inspired by our vision, share our values, and who have the attitude and skills required to help Acurable succeed.",
