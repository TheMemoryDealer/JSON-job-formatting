  "slogan": "Insurami - Eliminating office space deposits",
  "description": "Insurami is a tech-first insurance platform entering the market with a novel product.\n\nTheir first product provides an alternative for the traditional office space security deposit. Using their product, Landlords can instantly vet new tenants from a credit risk perspective and issue a financial guarantee instead of taking a security deposit. This product provides tenants with a vastly less capital intensive way to secure an office space whilst keeping landlords protected. \n\nAccurately predicting the risk of tenants is a really hard problem and Insurami is a pioneer in this field. They are working with some of the UK's largest landlords, with an exciting growth pipeline.",
