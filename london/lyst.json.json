Alongside product managers, user researchers and engineers, you’ll ensure that every product decision we make builds value for both our business and our users.\n\n \n\n**Company**\n\nLyst is the largest fashion search platform in the world.

This requires both commercial sensitivity as well as user-centred thinking, and means there are plenty of complex and exciting design and research challenges to solve.\n\nRecently, we’ve been working on:\n\n- More powerful tools for searching a massive inventory. We have millions of fashion items on Lyst, so how do we blend design and data science to only show what's relevant?\n- Smarter ways to learn about our customers' preferences, and more useful ways to filter results.

The below is to give you a sense of what we’re generally looking for. Please do consider applying even if you feel that not all of these apply to you - if we can help you improve and grow in some of these areas, all the better!\n\n \n- Experience working as a product designer in an in-house environment - ideally you will have worked in close collaboration with user researchers, product managers and engineers and know how to bring out the best in all of them\n- Commercial pragmatism - you’ll have a keen interest in how the business works, and will be able to translate this into your own decision-making\n- Thoughtful approach to design - your decisions will be based around a deep understanding of the problem to solve\n- A flexible way of working and a broad toolkit - you’ll be autonomous and able to adjust your process to suit the project\n- Great listening and communication skills - you’ll be able to communicate complex ideas clearly and concisely to colleagues at all levels of the business \n\n**Benefits**\n\n- You get 29 days’ time off throughout the year to take a well earned rest, 7 of which have to be taken when the office is closed over Christmas.
