  "description": "We think shared spaces platforms like Airbnb,  have not evolved much for a while. That's why we built a better one from scratch aiming for a market network that gives all the tools hosts need, while taking the traveler from A back to A in the most seamless way. Pretty much like ordering an Uber the experience is worry-free and you are kept in the loop every single step of the way.",
