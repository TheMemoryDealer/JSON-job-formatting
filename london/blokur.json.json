  "description": "\nDid you know that it can take a songwriter up to four years to get paid when their song is played on the radio or a streaming service?\n\nThat’s because the data that tells the world who wrote the song and who owns it is very often missing, incomplete or out-of-date.\n\nWe are tackling this problem at Blokur by building a new system of record for music rights data to make sure that whenever a song is played, the right person gets paid.\n\nOur company was founded from the lived experience of an artist on the front line of the music industry, and is driven by a diverse and creative team of technologists, music fans and business brains motivated by our mission to fulfill the potential of the internet for the creator.\n\nWe are off to a flying start – partnered with the world’s biggest and most influential music companies and artists, and backed by top tier investors.\n\nCome join us as we build out new infrastructure for the music industry and improve the lives of creators around the world.",
