  "description": "LITHO Hardware:\nLITHO itself is a small finger-worn controller that connects to your smartphone or headset. The controller has a touch surface on the underside, an array of motion sensors and provides haptic feedback.\n\nLITHO Software:\nThe controller is complemented by the LITHO SDK for Unity that - by fusing data from the phone’s camera and the motion sensors in the controller - provides context-aware pointing information.\n\nThis allows developers to make apps which can not only identify the direction in which the wearer is pointing, but also what they are pointing at in the real world.\n\nThe LITHO SDK also provides an interaction framework of off-the-shelf solutions to core interactions, including templates for tools such as object creation, movement and deletion, making it easy for developers to quickly build delightful and intuitive augmented reality (AR) experiences.",
