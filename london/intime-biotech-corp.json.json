      "description": "Hi. Perhaps with self-isolation and remote work you have a little more time, part of which you can devote to something more than just work.\r\n\r\nInTime Biotech LLC (Delaware, USA) is associated with the interaction of technology with humans, \"we help the code to help people\"! We will be glad if you help us to launch AntiCoronaVirus online tracker based on our MVP 1.0 (AntiObesity) in 2-3 weeks and help the current team not to delay launching MVP with version 2.0, which will fight Stroke &amp; Heart attack.\r\n\r\nWe continue to assemble an international team and recently released the first version of MVP, according to the brief description of the product (in the link below). The terms indicated in the brief are given for guidance and may vary depending on the competencies recruited by new team members. We can be useful to each other if you are satisfied with our form of payment - a share in the authorized capital of our company for part-time work in your free time.\r\n\r\nA couple of publications that have recently been published about our company in Russian media, (since we have chosen as the test region Russia, due to our original location) on RBC TV, Kommersant newspaper and Evening Moscow TV:\r\n\r\nKommersant: https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/4300795 \r\n(in English: https://yadi.sk/d/QvnkIsstikieNw )\r\n\r\nRBC: https://yadi.sk/i/oUIjjehXTxZ4pw\r\n\r\nEvening Moscow TV: https://vm.ru/news/788392-futurolog-nazval-datu-kogda-chelovechestvo-obretet-bessmertie\r\nhttps://vm.ru/tv/789261-skvoznoj-efir-26-marta-chast-3 (from 44 min. 30 sec.)\r\nhttps://vm.ru/tv/786325-ekspert-oleg-teterin-chto-budet-esli-chelovek-budet-zhit-do-150-let\r\n\r\nYou can use online translators to have an English version of these publications.\r\n\r\nIt’s hard to understand right away how good anyone is, but I think that if we agree on the conditions of work for a shares, then this is a mutual compromise and we make steps towards each other, and the first step is, essentially, made by you and when the time comes, if suddenly something goes wrong on your part (everything can be), we will also make the step towards you. In other words, without trying, you will never understand. \r\n\r\nWe want to build something special with small steps, which we can be proud of. We believe that we can, by making an online tracker, catch diseases at the stages where no one has caught them yet and give recommendations on how to avoid these diseases. Scientists have proven that any disease can be avoided by catching it long before the time of the disease. We believe that in doing so we will increase life by an average of 20 years. \r\n\r\nPitch Deck:\r\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1P7Jj2lxN0BTt2pDR1t1Z1owmee3tUyNk/view?usp=sharing\r\n\r\nFuture Longevity Vision:\r\nhttps://yadi.sk/i/R7clfDptyYCyLA\r\n\r\nMore details in the attached file from my speech at the Moscow State University at the Biotechnology Faculty: https://yadi.sk/d/AAjG8zflGIHqyw\r\n\r\nOur slogan, which lays down in the goal and mission of our company: “let's see how our children will raise their grandchildren” (not our grandchildren, but their ... how many years is this, have you calculated?))\r\n\r\nI suggest starting:\r\n1. We discuss the volume of your work in relation to the brief, which is more \"wishes to the final product\", based on your competence.\r\n\r\n2. We evaluate in money and what will be the result we fix in an agreement where it will be clearly written that if the output is what you agreed on and +/- meet the deadlines, then your share is yours, if there are significant deviations from the results and deadlines ( we will write in the contract), then the share either does not transfer or is much smaller, but with the right to return to the original size, if you correct the situation or bring something significant to the company (speed up the next stage of development, etc.). Our team believes that this scheme of work is not free, but rather paid at times more than the current real cost of your costs, because by the time of the sale of part of the share, the share will increase.\r\n\r\nWhy is our company considered less risky than another - because we are in a biotechnological trend, in the trend of distance medicine and in the trend of the market of goods and services aimed at prolonging an active life of a person. How many such companies do you know?\r\n\r\n3. We convert this to a fraction based on the assumption that the company is now worth $ 29.4 million. The assessment is determined by the progress of the company on the current date, the assessment of external consultants and potential investors, transactions with the current team of 25 IT developers, 7 shareholders, 10 experts and, of course, the inherent potential. We are the first startup in the world with so many like-minded people working for the end result without traditional salaries in the field of biotechnology. The whole team believes in what we are building, so it invests its time and part of its life in a product created by our own hands. Team, experts are from 7 countries and speak 6 languages.\r\n\r\n4. We discuss the following amount of work on the terms of 1-2 points of this letter, convert it from the current (at the time of discussing the new scope of tasks) company valuation\r\n\r\n5. At any stage, when real cash enters the company, we can switch from payment in the form of a share to the cash, while retaining the earned share, which you will agree to capitalize, developing our joint company already. We can also stipulate the terms for the purchase of your share from you after the investment has entered.\r\n\r\nIf the approach suits you, I’m waiting for an answer from you on 1-2 points sent to teterin@intime.digital\r\n\r\nPlease carefully read the documents in the links, this is more our vision. If we go further, then with those documents that will follow, including the contract. \r\nHow much carefully you read it will show how accurate you are in your professional field, because the development does not tolerate a superficial attitude, as well as our health, on which, no matter how trivial, the term of our life depends!\r\n\r\nWe already have a development team with these competencies, but we want to strengthen it: mobile and backend developers with a must: Django 2+ years, Django REST framework, Python 3.7, PostgreSQL, MySQL, RabbitMQ, Nginx. Would be a plus: Gunicorn, Vue/React JS, GCP Pub/Sub, GCP Compute Engine, GCP Functions\r\n\r\nAlso need help with the design and development of UI / UX design. We are looking for team leads. iOS development team we want to add specialists with the knowledge of Swift, RxSwift, MVC/MVVM, AutoLayout+IB, Codable to correct / upgrade UI, to write modules in RIBs architecture, work with data modules coing from backend Moya -&gt; Codable -&gt; CollectionView/TableView\r\n\r\nThe back office needs technical and business analysts, marketing managers, SMM specialists, sales, lawyers - in general, we are completing the formation of the team in the next week, we are considering candidates who are ready to study if we have not yet managed to get used to something.\r\n\r\nWe pay special attention to the development of Data Science, Big Data, ML, AI, Data Mining, Computer Vision, and the applicants with knowledge in the fields of medicine, biology, chemistry and physics. We are looking for specialists in hardware (wearable electronics) and RDT (rapid diagnostic testing), using the example of such a device https://atomodiagnostics.com (created by the Australian government).\r\n\r\nOur stage today: PoC (proof of concept), finished MVP AntiObesity (14 parameters), development of AntiCoronaVirus (14 parameters)\r\n\r\nOur nearest development plan, which will be completed soon:\r\n1) Custom Usermodel; 2) Pages for website (incl. Dashboard, Login / Logout, Register) 3) CMS / Admin panel. 4) DataBase for health parameters. 5) Creating MVP for obesity 6)\r\nThe development of an algorithm that creates a private forecast of the life span of a specific person based on an array of data (marked up information) according to the dependence of certain diseases on specific parameter indicators (analyzes and other bio-dates) of a particular person. 7) Creating MVP AntiCoronaVirus.\r\n\r\nI will wait for an answer and comments to teterin@intime.digital.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n-\r\nTeterin Oleg\r\n\r\nFounder, CEO\r\nLongevity InTime BioTech\r\n\r\n+79852287192\r\n+17187104509\r\n\r\nTo book a whatsapp call, please follow this link: https://calendly.com/teterinoleg/15min",
