  "description": "We’re focused on helping organizations become more productive and make better decisions by interconnecting their workplace data and making it all super-accessible and actionable anywhere by their employees. \n\nThe Relefant platform aggregates, interconnects and organizes data using graph technologies, which is easily and intuitively accessible via our visual application. \n\nCustomers are small to large companies that have multiple applications and data sources. The larger a company is, the number of poorly integrated systems and applications increases, along with complexity, information fragmentation and inefficiency costs.  \n\n",
