  "description": "The product we are building is an app / website. It will help people gather their pension pots into one place (screen) to see how much they've got, what they can do with it, and how well it is performing. The last part is the really exciting thing about what we're doing. We will be the first company to provide value for money scores for people's pension pots. We do this by using our bespoke algorithm which we have created through lots of hard work over the last year.\n\nThe value for money scores that we create will help the customer see how well each of their pension pots are performing based on historic performance. This will allow them to make a decision as to whether they would like to stick with the pension pots they have, consolidate all of them into one big pot or do a bit of both!\n\nOur customer is anyone with a pension in the UK, but our target market are 40-55 year olds as they are closest to drawing out their pension.",
