  "description": "Canopy is reinventing renting through its unique RentPassport. By downloading the mobile or web app for free and building their Rent Passport. Rather than having to find a large cash lump sum (on average £2,700 per property in London), renters can choose to purchase DepositFree cover provided by Hiscox. There’s currently £4.2billion of deposits held in protection schemes, which we’re certain can be put to better use. \n\nSignificantly, we’re about to launch a revolutionary product which allows renters to boost their credit score, all by simply paying their rent on time to their landlord as they normally would.",
