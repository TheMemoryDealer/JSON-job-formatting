  "description": "Fellowship Program:\nData Science is not knowledge to be acquired but rather an art that can be learned through practice.  The number one qualification employers look for when hiring a data science candidate is previous experience.  The Startup.ML fellowship gives aspiring data scientists the chance to hone their skills by building machine learning systems for startups.  \n\nWorking with Startups:\nWe help startups use machine learning as a key differentiator. Our world-class data scientists actively engage with startups for a year to ensure that machine learning techniques are successfully embedded into new products and a smooth transition is made to an in-house team.  We then take on the role of a trusted advisor and provide counsel to founders to set them up for continued success.",
