  "slogan": "A chatbot that helps refugees navigate resettlement and connect with legal aid",
  "description": "Marhub is developing a migration management platform that seeks to change the way refugees access,and NGOs provide information and services in chronic and emerging humanitarian crises. Leveraging a chatbot on Facebook messenger and Telegram, Marhub enables refugees to navigate resources and seek help on their own terms--in their own languages, on their preferred platforms, and on their own time. As a proof of concept, Marhub has partnered with a legal aid NGO to connect refugees with tailored resettlement information and legal assistance, and to streamline the organizationâ€™s screening and triage processes. In addition to expanding access to legal aid for vulnerable refugees and establishing a mobile communication channel for NGO partners, Marhub builds capacity for high-performing, under-resourced organizations and helps improve resource allocation for humanitarian assistance.",
