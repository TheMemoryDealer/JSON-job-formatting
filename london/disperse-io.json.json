Someone who can quickly take ownership across a variety of roles, from analysing project documentation, project managing the delivery and quality across customer accounts, to supporting the design of our product and processes. If you’re eager to learn, and aren’t afraid to dive straight into new challenges, this is a unique opportunity to be part of creating the way buildings will be designed, built and operated in the future.\n\nThe job of an architect at Disperse isn’t like your typical architect gig. We harness the characteristics that come naturally to engineers: creative problem-solvers, being bottomless idea wells, superhuman work ethics, and the ability to adapt on the fly - and unleash these across the business. You’ll find yourself as part-construction and architecture specialist, part-digital product designer, part-business strategist, as well as the voice of the industry.\n\nYour main responsibility will be to ensure that we onboard new projects, project manage their delivery and deliver value to our customers from day one. It’ll be your job to create the connection between our customer's project plans, the construction site and our product. You’ll be working in our project team, as well closely with our customers, product and computer vision teams. You’ll be experiencing first-hand what it takes to scale up a tech startup and will get the opportunity to work on some of the most prestigious projects in the world, starting from UK and US market.\n\nNOTE: This role is available in Sarajevo and Mostar (Bosnia and Herzegovina). Strictly non-remote.\n\nDesired start date as soon as possible.\n\n**Our culture**\n\nAsk anyone at Disperse what they love most about working here, and they'll probably tell you \"it's the people!\", \"the team, of course\", \"the people and the Hedwig owls in the offices\".\n\nAs clichéd as it may sound, we're very proud of the people we have and the close-knit, family culture we've built across London, Sarajevo, Mostar and Yerevan. Despite the distances, we're united through the passion with which we approach our goals and the fun that we have along the way. The following should give you a good idea what type of culture you'd be joining:\n\n- We encourage proactivity and taking full ownership of problems and initiatives. We don't believe in micromanagement. Instead, we let you pave your own path and give you the space to continuously learn and grow even if it means taking a few detours.\n- We support each other. If a process breaks or if you're struggling, you can always count on the people around you and the people far away from you, to help you get back on track.\n- We run on feedback: direct and transparent praise and constructive criticism, communicated with the best of intentions. There is no other way to learn!\n- Ideas and approaches are always judged on merit rather than source. We welcome discussions and challenges. This way everyone makes a tremendous impact no matter the role.\n\n**Requirements**\n\nYou should apply if:\n\n- You are ambitious and passionate about creating something meaningful\n- You're available for an immediate start \n\n- You have a Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in Architecture\n- You have some experience at an architectural office\n- You have a good understanding of the construction process\n- You are a highly motivated ‘self-starter’\n- You’re excited to collaborate with construction teams, architects, operations and project managers\n- You're a quick learner who picks up new skills, digital tools and information quickly\n- Strong Proficiency in English\n\n**Benefits**\n\n- Competitive salary + generous equity compensation\n- Open and transparent culture\n- Opportunity to join a talented seed-stage startup with proven traction early in its journey\n- Completely different and dynamic work approach\n- Positive working environment\n",

We harness the characteristics that come naturally to engineers: creative problem-solvers, being bottomless idea wells, superhuman work ethics, and the ability to adapt on the fly - and unleash these across the business. You’ll find yourself as part-construction, architecture and mechanical specialist, part-digital product designer, part-business strategist, as well as the voice of the industry.\n\nYour main responsibility will be to ensure that we onboard new projects, focusing on MEP phase, project manage their delivery and deliver value to our customers from day one. It’ll be your job to create the connection between our customer's project plans, the construction site and our product. You’ll be working in our project team, as well closely with our customers, product and software engineering teams.

Despite the distances, we're united through the passion with which we approach our goals and the fun that we have along the way. The following should give you a good idea what type of culture you'd be joining:\n\n- We encourage proactivity and taking full ownership of problems and initiatives. We don't believe in micromanagement. Instead, we let you pave your own path and give you the space to continuously learn and grow even if it means taking a few detours.\n- We support each other. If a process breaks or if you're struggling, you can always count on the people around you and the people far away from you, to help you get back on track.\n- We run on feedback: direct and transparent praise and constructive criticism, communicated with the best of intentions. There is no other way to learn!\n- Ideas and approaches are always judged on merit rather than source. We welcome discussions and challenges. This way everyone makes a tremendous impact no matter the role.\n\n**Requirements**\n\nYou should apply if:\n\n- You are ambitious and passionate about creating something meaningful\n- You're available for an immediate start \n\n- You have a Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in Mechanical engineering\n- You have a good understanding of MEP systems of residential and non-residential buildings\n- You are familiar with BIM \n- You are a highly motivated ‘self-starter’\n- You’re excited to collaborate with construction teams, architects, operations and project managers\n- You're a quick learner who picks up new skills, digital tools and information quickly\n- Strong Proficiency in English\n\n**Benefits**\n\n- Competitive salary + generous equity compensation\n- Open and transparent culture\n- Opportunity to join a talented seed-stage startup with proven traction early in its journey\n- Completely different and dynamic work approach\n- Positive working environment\n",

      "description": " **About Us**\n\nEver wondered how skyscrapers like One World Trade get built? It takes a heroic effort across a huge team of designers, builders, and managers, to name a few. But everyone in the industry knows that the process isn’t ideal: almost 70% of projects run more than 10% over budget, and 75% are completed significantly late. Disperse is helping our customers overcome these challenges by empowering them to transform. We provide cutting edge AI (computer vision) solutions to revolutionize the way construction gets delivered.\n\n \n\nOver the past year, our four offices (London, New York, Sarajevo, and Yerevan) have joined forces to build a product and service that our customers love. We’ve just raised a Series A funding round, and we’re kickstarting a new stage of global growth. If you’re entrepreneurial, motivated to solve new problems and unafraid of new challenges, you’re right for Disperse - a creative, conscientious, and proudly diverse community of AI experts, software engineers, architects, designers and businesspeople dedicated to helping build the skylines of tomorrow!\n\n \n\n**Your Role**\n\nSitting within our business development team, the Strategic Customer Lead is responsible for growing relationships within our most important customer accounts, closing the loop between customer needs and product design and guiding customers on their digital transformation journeys as we scale with them. This role exists at the intersection of solution engineering, product management and customer success, and responsibilities include identifying and building strong relationships with key stakeholders in our customer organizations, defining vision and success roadmaps and helping customers to succeed in their mission to improve how they build. The role also holds great influence over the direction and development of new product features and our product roadmap; you’ll need to take the lead on structuring product feature experiments, collecting and sorting through North American customer feedback- understanding and unpicking where the true value lies, identifying which solution elements are top priorities and then working with product managers, designers and engineers to integrate new developments into the product development pipeline.\n\n \n\nOver the past 24 months we’ve landed successful pilot programs with key customers and expanded across project portfolios with a project-by-project sales model at some of the largest, most forward-thinking real estate developers and contractors in the U.K. and US. But, for this next stage of growth, we need to build on this momentum to establish deeper, enterprise-level partnerships and transition from a value-add partner to the core platform with which our customers manage and deliver construction projects at scale across their portfolios.\n\n \n\nYou will be responsible for making the case for Disperse scaling within these organizations, including both the financial case in ROI calculations and the non-financial elements of our value proposition for different users at different customer organizations (contractors, developers and financiers, etc), and running various product experiment to unlock enterprise value.\n\n \n\nWe are a scale-up, which means what you do day to day will change. We value versatile and entrepreneurial candidates who thrive wearing multiple hats and seek opportunities to build and improve outcomes, processes and ways of working. Within the Customer team, we work closely with: the Product team to structure and guide product feature experiments, inform and guide the development roadmap, the Project Delivery team to support project kick-offs and pilot success, the Marketing team to document and amplify success stories. We value candidates who are empathetic to the needs and workload of others, a clear communicator and supportive team player. If you’re eager to learn and aren’t afraid to dive straight into new challenges, then this role is a great opportunity to grow and develop a multidisciplinary skill-set as part of a world-class team.\n\n**Some of the work that you might be doing includes:**\n\n- Growing strong relationships with our senior stakeholders at our most important customer accounts to establish us an advisor on their digital productivity journey.

Develop our Enterprise proposition; how we can truly move the needle at an organizational level for our customers and champions. Building out a scalable, repeatable model and structure for growing strategic accounts\n- Build a clear perspective and framework for informing the prioritization of our product roadmap in tandem with priorities, technologies and initiatives our strategic customers are driving, with a clear bias towards generating holistic value vs vanity tech \n- Prioritize, co-design and manage new product feature experiments across customer accounts to ensure we are moving in the right direction on a customer account and product-level \n- Form and uphold the culture of the company and the personal development of the Strategic Customer team members\n\n**Requirements**\n\n- You have worked for 3-5 years in a customer facing and / or product management role\n- You are a structured thinker and problem-solver, with excellent written and verbal communicator and a knack for always finding the right tone\n- You are personable, and genuinely care about helping others succeed, both within customer organizations and within your team\n- You enjoy telling stories to guide customer’s thinking, both in person and through content\n- You love working with data, extracting insights and translating them into strong business cases\n- You are solution-oriented: you don’t accept the status quo and are always looking for ways to make things better\n- You’re a lifelong learner who picks up new skills and information quickly\n- You’re a highly motivated self-starter who is passionate about creating something meaningful\n- You’re based in the greater NYC area\n\n**In addition, it is useful but not essential, if:**\n\n \n\nYou have previous exposure to the construction industry\n\nYou have previous experience in a startup environment\n\n**Benefits**\n\nYou will learn about all areas of the business and will be expected to contribute in every area, as we all do.
