  "description": "Third Way is a unique, online network, where top lawyers can confidentially see which firms are looking for candidates with their experience.\n\nOnly lawyers with suitable experience are give access to the platform, in the form of a user account.  Once they have signed in, they can view jobs at firms matched to them by various criteria.  These jobs will either be posted by the Third Way team, or directly by employers who are looking to avoid agency fees.  All of them are branded and we have signed up most of the top law firms and a great selection of financial institutions and major corporations.\n\nOur mission is to use technology to create a smarter way for lawyers to engage with the jobs market, taking on the traditional recruitment agencies, who currently rely on anonymous job board / social media postings or  teams of inexperienced juniors to cold call big lists of potential candidates.\n\nWe use C# programming language for the back end and ASP.NET for the front end.",
