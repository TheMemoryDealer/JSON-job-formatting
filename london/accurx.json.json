We’ve grown from being used in a handful of organisations at the beginning of 2018, to now being in over 1 in 3 practices that send over 50000 messages a day to patients – improving care and saving staff over half an hour each day.\n\nOver the next 12 months we’re growing our practice base in the UK and rolling out exciting new products to enable the future of primary care.",

Our mission is simple - to change lives by bringing patients and their healthcare teams together. Our technology is revolutionising how technology is adopted and how care is delivered in healthcare.\n\nEstablished in 2016 and now with £9m in Series A funding, accuRx is one of the UK's fastest-growing tech start ups. In one year, we grew from only a few GP practices using us to over 20% of the market. Today, over 70% of GP practices rely on us, we've just gone live in pharmacies and hospitals. Our vision is that anyone involved in a patient's care can communicate with each other.\n\nIn the past 18 months accuRx has grown from being used by 20 GP practices to 5500+, with over 90,000+ users every day. And we certainly won't be slowing down any time soon.\n\nIn response to the COVID-19 crisis, in the last few weeks, we've been working tirelessly to release multiple features that directly help clinicians deal with the outbreak - this has included a Virtual Consultation platform for both GP and Hospital settings.\n\nThis has meant some late hours and even weekend work but the feedback we have received has been truly amazing! We are exceptionally proud of our NHS and all the work they do, this is our way of saying thank you.\n\n### **Life as a Product Designer at accuRx**\n\nWe are looking for a well-rounded Product Designer to help us shape the future of communication in healthcare.\n\nWorking closely with our Lead Product Designer and the wider Product team, you will contribute across a broad spectrum of impactful projects from day one. As one of the first few Product Designers in to the business you'll have a huge part to play in shaping what we build.\n\nAs a Product Designer at accuRx you will give life to ideas by:\n\n- Researching with users and intimately understanding their needs\n- Testing with prototypes that can be easily disposed of or iterated on to learn more\n- Refining through high fidelity mock-ups that solve the problem at hand\n- Delivering through embedding yourself in the delivery of work\n\nOn top of that you'll work with a team of cross-functional team-mates to achieve a common vision. We value collaboration above all else, so sharing work early and often is vital. We see feedback as one of our greatest tools for refining and shaping ideas. That means Product Designers at accuRx need to feel just as comfortable letting go of solutions, as they do championing them.\n\nAt accuRx, we are about to embark on the next part of our journey and we are looking for inspirational and talented people to help lead the way.\n\n### **We'd really like to hear from you, if...**\n\n- You have over 2 years proven experience in a Product Design role\n- You have demonstrable product design skills, such as:\n  - A backlog of user research tactics to help shape the problem\n  - A knack for effective prototyping – opting for the best tool for the job\n  - A strong base of visual design skills – well-grounded in the fundamentals\n  - A value for exceptional craft in user interface design, and the desire to achieve it\n  - A systems view of the world, and the need to simplify complex interactions\n  - A natural communication style with a proficiency in clear and concise writing\n- You have experience contributing to a design system\n- You have experience designing complex products for a diverse group of users\n- You follow user-centric design methodologies and put research at the heart of your solutions\n- You like to embrace the small details that ultimately define the product\n- You are passionate about or you already have experience in the healthcare industry\n- You are mission-driven and care about creating something amazing that will impact the lives of millions\n- You are excited by change and a fast paced learning environment\n- You share our values – and want to add to them!
