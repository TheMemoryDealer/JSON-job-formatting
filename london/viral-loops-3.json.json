      "description": "About Viral Loops.\n\nViral Loops is a viral and referral marketing platform to launch ranking competitions, sweepstakes, pre-launch, and referral programs.\n\nBut you probably know that from our meta-description.\n\nSo, yes. We are a platform that generates leads and retains customers for our users, but we are much more than that.\n\nI don’t know if the things we do are ahead of our time, or if we are that much different from other people under similar circumstances.\n\nWhat I know is that we live in a society where “work hard”, “hustle” and “making money moves” are part of quote posts on Instagram.\n\nAlthough we recognize those mentioned above as essential parts of running a successful business, I don’t think that they are- by any means, the reason for somebody to belong to our team.\n\nFrom day #1, our primary focus is the people.\n\nWhat we want is to allow ourselves to discover what we like and what we hate about what we do, make mistakes, and move on with our lives whether this means that we’ll continue being part of the pack or choose to separate our paths from it.\n\nThis is what Viral Loops is.\n\n\nOur Content Strategy.\n\nSince our very early days, Viral Loops’ growth relies heavily on organic traffic.\n\nThroughout the years, we managed to build a respectable name among marketing blogs, and we plan, not only to live up to this name but to expand as well.\n\nThere’s only one goal considering our blog, and that is to make it a publication with the velocity of Hubspot, or Moz. We know that we share the aspiration with the rest of the marketing blogs out there, but there are not many players offering the kind of value we do.\n\nOur blog works as an independent marketing funnel. That means that we have more than one target readers.\n\nOn the bottom of this funnel (and closer to conversion), some people already know about referral marketing, and want to know how to use it to grow their business.\n\nAnother target audience is the people who want to generate more leads for their businesses.\nRight now, we offer our readers articles with actionable tactics about lead generation, and also in-depth referral marketing case studies- both from our client cases and from other companies that used referral marketing to grow.\n\nOur primary focus as a company, for the last three quarters, is Messenger marketing (since we launched our referral marketing templates for Messenger bots) & eCommerce businesses.\n\nHere are some samples from our recent work:\n\n- Guide: Facebook & Instagram ads for giveaways\n- Get more Messenger subscribers: A blueprint\n- Dropbox grew 3900% with a simple referral program. Here’s how!\n- Marketing a CBD brand without paid advertising\n- 4K+ leads in 5 days with a Manychat giveaway – Case Study\n- A secret method for generating sales via Facebook Messenger\n\n\nStyling guides.\n- The tone of the blog is light but informative. We try to keep the reading experience as simple as possible.\n- You must include images and screenshots that justify the point you’re trying to make. In the past, we decided to incorporate GIFs in our articles, but it didn’t work well (lol).\n- All blog posts should go in-depth on the subject you’re writing about.\n- Blog post length should be between 1000–2000 words, of unique content. Please, no plagiarism.\n\n\nThe Test.\n\nHiring a gifted writer is very, very difficult. We are not just looking for an individual with excellent writing skills.\n\nWe are looking for someone that fits our vibe.\n\nIf you think you have what we’re looking for, please email us at writers@viral-loops.com\nPlease also use the following subject line (it will be easier for us to track your email):\n“I think I should be the new writer for Viral Loops”\n\nBased on the things you read for our blog above, please include in your email, three proposed headlines, along with a brief description for every headline.\n\nIf we see something that we think fits our needs, we’ll pick one of the headlines and ask you to write a test post about it.\n\nThis test post will evaluate if it’s possible for us to work together.\n\nIn case your test post fits what we need, we’ll pay you for it and hop on a 30-minute call to discuss the necessary details.\n\nIf your test post doesn’t pass the evaluation, you can use it however, you wish.\n\n\nFacts that the applicants should be aware of.\n- We will only hire independent contractors.\n- You’re going to be paid on a per-post rate.\n- You’ll receive payment for published posts only.\n- From the moment we publish your article, Viral Loops owns the content.",
