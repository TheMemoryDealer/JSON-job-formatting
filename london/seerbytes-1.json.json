However, key regions of focus are likely to be the UK, US, Europe and the Middle East. And target project sizes are in excess of $10,000 per project - ideally $100k to $500k projects (we already have clients/projects within these ranges).\n\nWe are happy to work on an hourly or fixed rate basis for your services. But as we have been burnt in the past. As a result, we would give preference to candidates who are either (a) open to commission type arrangement OR (b) fee per successful project secured (at least initially) OR (c) provide some guarantees (e.g. X projects of min $Y amount per month). Please note - while this would be a key criteria in making our decision, it is not the only factor - we would focus more on individual profiles, previous experience and a successful track record. As ideally, we want to find a long term partner leading to a mutually beneficial working relationship.\n\nThe ideal candidate will be strong in the areas we operate in, be a business dev/sales expert with years of experience, have a strong track record of success AND most importantly have a fantastic network to tap into. If you apply, please include \"Red apple.\" at the beginning of your response to help us identify auto-responses from those that took the time to read our requirements carefully.\n\nCan you also pls answer the following questions:\n\n1) Why do you believe you are the perfect fit for this role?\n\n2) Please provide relevant experience including results achieved?\n\n3) Do you have a strong network of potential clients? If yes, provide details. And how do you intend them to convert?\n\n4) Outside your existing network, how do you plan to target new potential clients? How will you get them to convert?\n\n5) What sort of a fee arrangement would you prefer initially (while I note we would discuss this properly if you are shortlisted, but at this stage please outline expectations of your fee at this stage along with some example of result/delivery expectations e.g. if commission based then % or $ amount per project OR if fixed/hourly then the $ amounts and expected results).",
