  "description": "As an agency, we have successfully designed, developed and taken to market a succession of our own digital tools and applications. With over 80,000 users our Twine App is a great example of our work. At its core, Twine is a modular based intranet that helps big companies work like small ones by bringing teams, content and ideas together.\n\nOver the next 6 months, we're looking to extend Twine's capabilities and expand into new markets, hence we're looking to increase the team with like-minded thinkers. If you are interested then give Twine a try for yourself at https://signup.twinehr.com\n",

Ideally, you’ll have at least three years of experience working in an agency or product development role with modern industry standard languages and practices.\n \nYour previous experience will have given you the confidence to voice your opinion on subjects such as UX design, development processes, and choosing the right tools for the tasks ahead. It’s okay if you don’t have experience working in an agile environment, or participating in discovery workshops - with ten years behind us we can teach you everything you’ll need to know.\n \nPerhaps your entrepreneurial spirit has even led you to build a few web apps of your own, if so then you’ll fit right in at one of our bi-annual JAMS hackathons.",
