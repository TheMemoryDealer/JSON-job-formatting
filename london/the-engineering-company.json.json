  "description": "Designing robots, wind turbines, rockets is expensive, slow, repetitive and can only be done by experts. Our technology massively accelerates design and lowers economic and technical barriers to entry, making inconceivable technologies possible.The Engineering Company is reinventing the way we develop complex hardware. Unlike software, industrial hardware is still designed at the lowest level, taking years and millions to develop. We are building the software abstraction layer that will one day power all industrial design and development. ",
