  "slogan": "Identity-as-a-Service for the aviation industry",
  "description": "Zamna is an award-winning VC backed software company, which was identified by IBM Security as a GDPR compliant Identity-as-a-Service for the aviation industry. It is a blockchain-based Identity Management Platform, which allows airlines to verify passenger identity prior to arriving at an airport. Our goal is to be the most successful company you’ve never heard of – invisibly facilitating passenger experiences such as seamless travel, allowing you to move through airports without your passport leaving your pocket and simply making queues a thing of the past.\n\nZamna software implementation is as frictionless as can be - with no new infrastructure needed for the airport or airline. Crucially, Zamna achieves better data validation and security by sharing no passenger personal data - in any form - with any 3rd parties. Our privacy-by-design architecture enshrines the principle that “the best way to keep data safe is not to have it at all”.\n\nZamna's co-founding team, Irra Khi and Alexander Gorelik, have taken the company from strength to strength since its inception in 2016. In 2018, IAG signed a commercial agreement to roll out Zamna capability across the group – starting with British Airways and Iberia. Zamna are also a Strategic Partner for IATA (world airline association) One ID, winner of IATA's inaugural innovation award, as well as HRH Duke of York's “Pitch at Palace” in 2018. Zamna recently won an engagement to deliver One ID for Emirates Airlines in a joint project with GDRFA (Federal Immigration Authority in Dubai) and have also briefed authorities in the US on a visit to Washington DC in the efforts to expand operations globally.\n\nZamna recently received $5 million seed round investment from Venture Capital firms including LocalGlobe, Oxford Capital, FOMCAP, CyLon and Seedcamp.",

      "title": "Client Operations Manager",
      "description": "**The Opportunity**\n\nThis is an incredible opportunity to join a growing and successful, innovative VC backed software business at a very exciting time. \n\nThe Client Operations Manager sits very closely alongside the CEO and is responsible for ensuring that her commercial activity, and that of the wider leadership team, is as efficient as possible. Currently, the majority of commercial relationships and client-facing meetings are led and managed exclusively by the CEO, with only logistical assistance from her EA. This role recognises a need for someone else to sit alongside the CEO and further alleviate this operational burden; elevating her effectiveness through fast, consistent and excellent commercial relationship management. This role is about capturing what the CEO can’t, widening her bandwidth, understanding who she’s meeting and why and ultimately ensuring that her time is spent in the best possible way. \n\nZamna’s clients are airlines and governments and as such the commercial advancement of the business depends on the ability of the CEO to develop effective relationships with a complex array of key stakeholders in large entities. This unavoidable reality has created a bottleneck both in her day to day ability to drive these relationships but also strategically in advancing commercial activity at large. As Zamna grows to take on more clients there is an emerging need to codify how the CEO spends this time and find where we can drive efficiencies to overcome these hurdles. \n\nZamna needs someone to ask questions such as, “What materials did the CEO use for this meeting last time?”, “Are they prepped and ready for this one?”, “Has everyone in this meeting actioned their deliverables?” This role needs someone who’s comfortable to drive processes from the bottom up, in the weeds first,  but also who questions why things are done. The former will require an extremely close working relationship with the CEO and the latter will involve collaborative work with the Head of Operations and incoming Chief Commercial Officer. \n\nThe Client Operations Manager is required first and foremost to understand the commercial world in which the CEO operates and be by her side wherever she is. Secondly, they are required to work out how we can scale this activity going forward as the commercial team grows. This role will entice a candidate that is ambitious, hardworking and thirsty to learn and push themselves to be the best they can – an internal drive which is shared by each member of the Zamna team! No ambition is too big, no job is too small – the team all do whatever it takes to achieve excellence. If you want an easy ride, this won’t be a good fit – but if you want to fuel some of the most professionally satisfying, varied, and invigorating experiences of your career, this is it. \n\nThe business has really taken off, success is clear and this is down to hard work and passion. The successful candidate must want to be invested in the company and what they do in order for Zamna to continue to work towards its full potential. The Client Operations Manager role will offer full exposure to the business in various capacities. Flexibility will be required, for example making sure you are on checking Telegram every evening when waiting for important information or just to be on hand/ checking out for any updates. Be connected in a mobile culture. Attention to detail is key in this role. The CEO needs someone she can rely on. This role is about managing people, not just supporting them. \n\n**Key Responsibilities**\n\n* Attend all commercial and client meetings with the CEO to support by capturing discussions and decisions and circulating actions in a timely manner to all stakeholders involved\n* Develop full visibility of the CEO’s commercial activity and know in advance what will be needed to get the most out of wherever she is spending her time\n* Assist in producing materials both for commercial activity (eg. documents, meeting minutes, presentations) and assist on written content for PR and comms efforts\n* Coordination of both internal and external communications with the highest professional integrity – your emails will be read by a range of people from airline CEOs to members of the royal family\n* Work closely with the EA to optimise the CEO’s diary with a focus on ensuring commercial relationships are being developed as best as possible\n* Assisting the CEO with a variety of administration tasks including but not limited to: accurate minute taking, and speed typing during intense verbal discussions, following up action points/ heavily chasing action points and unblocking CEO’s dependencies on others’ action points, responding to emails when you can independently - or alerting CEO to relevant emails which you cannot respond to independently\n* Work closely with the Head of Operations to iterate on the status quo, identifying ways that client-facing activity can be codified and conducted more efficiently - what tools / products / processes would help to maximise the CEO’s commercial impact\n* Assist the incoming CCO and wider team to coordinate all external stakeholder activity, ensuring that the right people are in the right places at the right time\n* Be the forward looking lens on the CEOs client-facing activity and ensure that she is informed and prepared at all times whilst maintaining her focus and prioritisation \n* Work to develop a framework and structure for how the CEO and broader commercial team interact with clients through defining language, process and cadence \n* Own client communication on behalf of the CEO - be comfortable drafting emails and speaking to senior stakeholders at enterprise level with clarity and consistency\n* Organise client-facing materials. Develop systems for keeping meeting minutes organised, documents secure and available for CEO / externals as needed\n* Above all else - close loops and never drop the ball; follow up faster than anyone else and get sh*t done\n\n**Ideal Candidate Characteristics**\n\n* Start up background or experience in a high-growth VC backed business pace, ideally B2B business in a customer / client-facing role\n* Hard working and logical thinker with experience supporting at the most senior level\n* Excellent communication skills, both written and verbal – and an affinity to connect with people around you and build relationships quickly\n* Excellent organisational and time management skills\n* Meticulous attention to detail - focused and responsive, able to deliver despite not understanding context (this is important given the role revolves around a very niche industry full of aviation speak)\n* Ability to multitask, take ownership and work at a very fast pace\n* Ability to process a substantial amount of information quickly, put it in perspective within context and formulate solutions and best course of action\n* The ability to work well under pressure, while being tactfully persistent \n* Exceptional technological literacy with particular proficiency in Microsoft Office software – Mail, Word, Excel, Powerpoint, Keynote\n* Happy to be in constant communication on Telegram App and phone working in ‘flow’ with connectivity sometimes required beyond core office hours\n* Excellent self management skills – strong personality with psychological and emotional stability, and excellent practical management\n\n**Location**\n\nThe role will be primarily based in Zamna's Hammersmith office with travel to attend client meetings as and when required.\n\n**Additional Information**\n\n* Zamna's [website](https://zamna.com/) \n* Zamna in the media: [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/26/zamna-raises-5m-to-automate-airport-security-checks-between-agencies-using-blockchain/), [CityAM](https://https://www.cityam.com/zamna-raises-5m-as-it-secures-deal-with-iag-for-airport-security-tech/), [The Times](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/start-up-zamna-tackles-airport-security-queues-3z9v272fh), [BBC](https://https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-45628825), [Bdaily](https://https://bdaily.co.uk/articles/2019/04/12/vchain-makes-mark-in-dubai-with-identity-tech), [Financial Times](https://https://www.ft.com/content/97778c1a-26a9-11e7-a34a-538b4cb30025), [Forbes](https://https://www.forbes.com/sites/oliversmith/2018/05/21/blockchain-startup-vchain-is-flying-high-after-its-royal-seal-of-approval/#1a3cd8f81ded), [PassengerTerminal](https://https://www.passengerterminaltoday.com/news/technology/vchain-tech-wins-iatas-inaugural-innovation-award.html)",
