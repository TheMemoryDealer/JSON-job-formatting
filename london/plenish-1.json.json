  "description": "We harness the power of plants to make delicious and nutritious drinks made from high quality, sustainably-sourced ingredients with absolutely none of the junk that so many big brands put in their products. Our philosophy is simple - we make products that contain everything you need and nothing you don't. \n\nOur focus is on plant-based dairy alternatives that help all of us to reduce our environmental impact by making it simple (and super delicious) to consume more plants and less of the animal products that take such a huge toll on the planet. \n\nWe sell our organic plant-based m*lks and cold-pressed juices in supermarkets and independent stores across the UK but the heart of our business is where we started - our direct-to-consumer e-commerce website plenishdrinks.com.",
