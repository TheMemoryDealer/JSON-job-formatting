  "description": "Our story started when our co-founders, whilst working as medical doctors, recognized that the holistic textbook version of medicine was not at all what was being provided for patients. The reality is that a stretched healthcare system fails to engage people in their medical care at the preventative stages.\n\nAs a result, the $3 trillion currently spent on healthcare goes on to prevents only 10% of premature deaths. With digital therapeutics, we have the opportunity to prevent 40% of premature deaths that are caused by behavioral patterns.\n\nQuit Genius is a behavior change platform that combines digital coaching, personalized content, wearable technology and medication to help people overcome addictive behaviors.",
