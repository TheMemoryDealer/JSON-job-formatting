But behind the scenes is the real story. This story is one of high growth, huge challenges and an enormous opportunity ahead of us. It began with our founder Will, arriving in London over 5 years ago and finding it almost impossible to order great food, despite the wealth of incredible restaurants in the city. Fast forward 5 years and we operate in 13 countries with over 50,000 riders who deliver orders from 50,000 restaurants in over 200 cities worldwide.\n\nWe want to be the definitive food company - the app you go to any time you have a hunger pang. We are transforming the way people think about food. We are providing people with limitless access to different cuisines and restaurants, turning cooking from a chore to a choice, and giving people the freedom to eat what they want, when they want, where they want it.\n\nWe work with riders, restaurants and consumers. We operate one of the most complex three sided marketplaces in the world and we do this in real time. Millions of customers and thousands of restaurants and riders rely on us to match them within milliseconds. The algorithms behind that marketplace are the secret sauce that allows us to deliver our orders in under 30 minutes.\n\nAnd we're just getting started\n\nThe scale of the opportunity ahead of us is immense. The global food market is valued at £7.7 trillion but only 1% of it is currently online. Contrast that with the digital disruption of countless other industries - from banking and travel to retail and communications - it's clear that our journey in the food sector has only just begun.\n\nWe are already a multi-billion pound company that is more than doubling in size every year. Deliveroo came top in the FT's' list of Europe's fastest growing 1000 companies in 2018, and we were the first company ever to win Deloitte's 'UK Top 50' two years in a row. Yet most of the extraordinary value this company will generate lies ahead of us.\n\n \n\nThe Role\n\nAs the CRM Life-cycle Manager you’ll be accountable for the operational delivery, optimisation & reporting on all automated campaigns, including budget management & ROI.  You’ll be responsible for using automation to improve operational efficiencies and grow our bottom line by leading the development of our CRM life-cycle program roadmap.  \n\nReporting into the Global CRM Director, and currently with 2 direct reports, you will be laser focused on creating, maintaining and optimising customer journeys as part of our marketing automation program. This includes journey initiation, design, configuration, audience segmentation and data interrogation to identify ongoing actionable insights.\n\nOur ideal candidate has a proven track record across CRM, with a strong understanding of utilising CRM Marketing Technology platforms to drive automation and scalability.  Overall, you'll want to create campaigns that are meaningful to customers, using the right channels at the right time and that have a positive business impact. \n\nYou’ll be a passionate and technical email marketer, who puts the customer at the centre of their campaign execution. You'll be the kind of person who enthusiastically looks at your metrics soon after a send, and you'll get excited about new ideas, new channels and new campaigns. You'll work well with others and arrive at kick-off meetings for a new campaign full of ideas (based on what we've learnt through data and your own inspiration).\n\n \n\nTo Do All Of This, You'll\n\n- \n\nOwn operational delivery, optimisation & reporting of all automated campaigns, including budget management & ROI\n\n- \n\nCollaborate with the CRM Strategy & Planning Manager to create & deploy effective, automated life-cycle campaigns across the business\n\n- \n\nPossess a clear insight to be able to see a goal, and then use CRM Marketing Technology to help achieve it faster and more efficiently than ever before\n\n- \n\nProactively report on all automated campaigns to stakeholders & propose/manage changes where necessary, to effectively manage spend vs budgets\n\n- \n\nWork collaboratively with other departments to ensure automated campaigns achieve company goals\n\n- \n\nDrive innovative ideas and solutions in response to business and customer needs\n\n- \n\nFocus on planning, execution, measurement & analysis in equal measure\n\n- \n\nProvide regular communication with stakeholders, such as the central marketing team, studio team and local markets, to ensure workloads & deadlines are managed efficiently (we love Slack channels for everything)\n\n \n\nMust Haves\n\n- \n\nBachelor's Degree (Marketing or Business preferred) or strong relevant experience\n\n- \n\nA minimum of 3-5 years email application experience (Braze preferred), including:\n\n  - \n\nHTML familiarity (ability to understand where changes need to be made)\n\n  - \n\nCSS (preferable)\n\n  - \n\nAdobe Creative Suite – Photoshop (preferred)\n\n  - \n\nEmail coding (responsive design)\n\n  - \n\nData visualisation tools (Looker experience preferred)\n\n- \n\nA minimum of 1-2 years of building automated, life-cycle CRM communications\n\n- \n\nStrong analytical mindset and an ability to analyse large volumes of complex, automated campaigns, knowing what to measure and how to infer actionable insights\n\n- \n\nStrong project management and collaboration skills with the ability to manage multiple tasks, projects and internal/external teams while sticking to deadlines.\n\n- \n\nExperience in working on a global or international scale\n\n- \n\nCuriosity about what’s next and how we can do better?\n\n \n\nLife at Deliveroo\n\nWe are a small team, with very large impact, seeking to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, we're always looking for new ideas and we're very transparent about the decisions we make and why we make them.\n\nThere are so many questions we need to answer and plenty more we haven't even encountered. How do data and technology help restaurants to grow as consumer habits change? How can we predict what someone wants to order for dinner long before the idea has even crossed their mind? At Deliveroo these are just some of the tough problems we are solving - and there is no challenge that cannot be yours. No solution is owned by a particular team, which means the scope for growth and personal impact is enormous.\n\n \n\nBenefits And Diversity\n\nAt Deliveroo we know that people are the heart of the business and we prioritise their welfare. We offer a wide range of competitive benefits in areas including health, family, finance, community, convenience, growth, time away and relocation.\n\nIn 2018 we announced our decision to give every employee equity in the company. We did this because we wanted all of our employees, regardless of location, level or role to be owners and because we believe that this is the right thing to do. We believe this helps build a culture where everyone is committed and able to share in the company's success.\n\nWe believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander. All you need is a passion for (most) food and a desire to be part of one of the fastest growing start-up's around.\n\n \n\n",

It began with our founder Will, arriving in London over 5 years ago and finding it almost impossible to order great food, despite the wealth of incredible restaurants in the city.  Fast forward 5 years and we operate in 13 countries with over 50,000 riders who deliver orders from 50,000 restaurants in over 200 cities worldwide.\n\nWe want to be the definitive food company - the app you go to any time you have a hunger pang. We are transforming the way people think about food. We are providing people with limitless access to different cuisines and restaurants, turning cooking from a chore to a choice, and giving people the freedom to eat what they want, when they want, where they want it.\n\nWe work with riders, restaurants and consumers. We operate one of the most complex three sided marketplaces in the world and we do this in real time. Millions of customers and thousands of restaurants and riders rely on us to match them within milliseconds. The algorithms behind that marketplace are the secret sauce that allow us to deliver our orders in under 30 minutes.\n\nAnd we’re just getting started\n\nThe scale of the opportunity ahead of us is immense. The global food market is valued at £7.7 trillion but only 1% of it is currently online. Contrast that with the digital disruption of countless other industries - from banking and travel to retail and communications - it’s clear that our journey in the food sector has only just begun.\n\nWe are already a multi-billion dollar company that is more than doubling in size every year.  Deliveroo came top in the FT’s’ list of Europe’s fastest growing 1000 companies in 2018, and we were the first company ever to win Deloitte’s ‘UK Top 50’ two years in a row.

But behind the scenes is the real story. This story is one of high growth, huge challenges and an enormous opportunity ahead of us. It began with our founder Will, arriving in London over 5 years ago and finding it almost impossible to order great food, despite the wealth of incredible restaurants in the city.  Fast forward 5 years and we operate in 13 countries with over 50,000 riders who deliver orders from 50,000 restaurants in over 200 cities worldwide. \n\n \n\nWe want to be the definitive food company - the app you go to any time you have a hunger pang. We are transforming the way people think about food. We are providing people with limitless access to different cuisines and restaurants, turning cooking from a chore to a choice, and giving people the freedom to eat what they want, when they want, where they want it. \n\n \n\nWe work with riders, restaurants and consumers. We operate one of the most complex three sided marketplaces in the world and we do this in real time. Millions of customers and thousands of restaurants and riders rely on us to match them within milliseconds. The algorithms behind that marketplace are the secret sauce that allow us to deliver our orders in under 30 minutes.\n\n \n\n**And we’re just getting started**\n\nThe scale of the opportunity ahead of us is immense. The global food market is valued at £7.7 trillion but only 1% of it is currently online. Contrast that with the digital disruption of countless other industries - from banking and travel to retail and communications - it’s clear that our journey in the food sector has only just begun.\n\n \n\nWe are already a multi-billion dollar company that is more than doubling in size every year.  Deliveroo came top in the FT’s’ list of Europe’s fastest growing 1000 companies in 2018, and we were the first company ever to win Deloitte’s ‘UK Top 50’ two years in a row. Yet most of the extraordinary value this company will generate lies ahead of us. \n\n \n\n**The Role**\n\nThe Head of SEM oversees an in-house team with a global remit located at our HQ in London. You will oversee the end-to-end management, strategy, delivery and optimisation for one of our largest and most impactful marketing channels.  \n   \nThe role works hand-in-hand with a number of cross functional disciplines including technology, data science and product.  \n   \nWe are looking for a deeply knowledgeable, passionate and dedicated expert to lead this fast paced and innovative function.   \n   \n**Responsibilities:**\n- Delivering and optimising a highly efficient, highly scalable Paid Search and App program working with a multi million pound budget to deliver consistent and significant growth for the business globally.\n- Responsible for the management and strategy of Google owned channels (including but not limited to Search, GDN, YouTube, UAC), Bing and Apple Search Ads.\n- Managing an in-house executional team of SEM specialists and technologists.\n- Working cross functionally with tech, data science, creative and product to develop roadmaps of work to help us scale faster, improve measurement and iterate quickly on creative.\n- Work collaboratively with local marketing teams and central planning functions to develop best in class campaigns to support wider marketing campaigns and initiatives.\n- Managing the relationship with key industry partners and suppliers.\n- Developing the optimal mix of spend between campaign and channel types.\n- Forecasting and budgeting.\n- Foster and nurture a culture of innovation, data and technology driven marketing in an ambitious team with a high impact.\n**Requirements:**\n- Proven track record of managing large scale, technical Paid Search accounts and ability to demonstrate the impact you had on the business on an on-going basis.\n- Structured data and feed expert.\n- Strong proven analytical skill set (SQL a plus)\n- Knowledge and implementation of scripts and using platform APIs to automate manual processes and safeguards.\n- Proven ability of working with product and technology teams to develop impactful tools that help automate and scale Paid Search campaigns.\n- Working in a multi-market capacity.\n\n**Life at Deliveroo**\n\nWe are a small team, with very large impact, seeking to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, we’re always looking for new ideas and we’re very transparent about the decisions we make and why we make them.\n\n \n\nThere are so many questions we need to answer and plenty more we haven’t even encountered. How do data and technology help restaurants to grow as consumer habits change? How can we predict what someone wants to order for dinner long before the idea has even crossed their mind? At Deliveroo these are just some of the tough problems we are solving - and there is no challenge that cannot be yours. No solution is owned by a particular team, which means the scope for growth and personal impact is enormous. \n\n \n\n**Benefits and Diversity **\n\nAt Deliveroo we know that people are the heart of the business and we prioritise their welfare. We offer a wide range of competitive benefits in areas including health, family, finance, community, convenience, growth, time away and relocation.\n\n \n\nIn 2018 we announced our decision to give every employee equity in the company. We did this because we wanted all of our employees, regardless of location, level or role to be owners and because we believe that this is the right thing to do. We believe this helps build a culture where everyone is committed and able to share in the company’s success.\n\n \n\nWe believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be.

But behind the scenes is the real story. This story is one of high growth, huge challenges and an enormous opportunity ahead of us. It began with our founder Will, arriving in London over 5 years ago and finding it almost impossible to order great food, despite the wealth of incredible restaurants in the city.  Fast forward 5 years and we operate in 13 countries with over 50,000 riders who deliver orders from 50,000 restaurants in over 200 cities worldwide.\n\n \n\nWe want to be the definitive food company - the app you go to any time you have a hunger pang. We are transforming the way people think about food. We are providing people with limitless access to different cuisines and restaurants, turning cooking from a chore to a choice, and giving people the freedom to eat what they want, when they want, where they want it.\n\n \n\nWe work with riders, restaurants and consumers. We operate one of the most complex three sided marketplaces in the world and we do this in real time. Millions of customers and thousands of restaurants and riders rely on us to match them within milliseconds. The algorithms behind that marketplace are the secret sauce that allow us to deliver our orders in under 30 minutes.\n\n \n\nAnd we’re just getting started\n\nThe scale of the opportunity ahead of us is immense. The global food market is valued at £7.7 trillion but only 1% of it is currently online. Contrast that with the digital disruption of countless other industries - from banking and travel to retail and communications - it’s clear that our journey in the food sector has only just begun.\n\n \n\nWe are already a multi-billion dollar company that is more than doubling in size every year.  Deliveroo came top in the FT’s’ list of Europe’s fastest growing 1000 companies in 2018, and we were the first company ever to win Deloitte’s ‘UK Top 50’ two years in a row. Yet most of the extraordinary value this company will generate lies ahead of us.\n\n-------------------------------\n\nThe best businesses in the world use data in everything they do, and it's our job to make that happen for Deliveroo.

As well as building clear reports and models, we aim to fully understand our data to derive insights that drive change in the business. And we do all of this at startup speed.\n\nAs a Quantitative Market Research Analyst (Marketing and Engagement) in the Business Analytics Team, your primary mission is to lead the provision of sophisticated data analysis, business intelligence, modelling and research services that increase the understanding of current and potential customers.\n\nResponsibilities:\n\n* Oversee Deliveroo’s customer research data collection and analysis\n* Conceive and develop research analysis to extend and improve Deliveroo's understanding of our customers\n* Champion the voice of the customer through clear storytelling which delivers insight derived from sound analysis\n\nWe are looking for data scientists and research professionals who bring fresh ideas from all areas with strong technical skills.
