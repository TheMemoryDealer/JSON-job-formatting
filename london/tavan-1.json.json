  "description": "Tavan is for the 150M+ runners/cyclists in the world. We initially launched with a weather-based clothing recommendation engine. Then we decided to pivot into route-building. Our data-driven route builder uses aggregated and anonymized activity data from athletes to generate the best route alternatives for other athletes. We're revolutionizing how athletes discover their surroundings. We have a culture that is very supportive of endurance training and sports. ",
