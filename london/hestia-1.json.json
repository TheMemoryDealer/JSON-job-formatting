  "description": "Hestia is an AI and Machine Learning augmented, state-of-the-art real estate marketplace where property buyers and sellers use an open electronic auction model (like capital markets) for fair price discovery to buy and sell properties.\n\nHestia provides buyers and sellers, access to a property professionals’ marketplace (conveyancers, architects, valuers, surveyors, et al) to help them complete the entire property transaction through a single interactive, intelligent, customizable workflow tool. \n\nThe Hestia platform applies intelligent technologies to provide relevant advanced data analytics, at every stage of the process, to educate the buyers and sellers for better decision making.\n\nMost importantly, Hestia is a commission free ‘world’, with no intermediaries thus providing a cheaper, safer and faster property transaction model. \n\nHestia will be implementing Blockchain technology to settle property transactions in future implementations.",
