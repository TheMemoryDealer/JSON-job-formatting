  "slogan": "Novel Grid Scale energy storage technology",
  "description": "OXTO Energy has developed OXTO ON, a patented flywheel based form of energy storage\n\nElectric energy is stored in the form of kinetic energy on a high-speed spinning energy wheel and is converted back to electric using a novel and efficient switching mechanism. OXTO is able to offer a very high round-trip efficiency while outweighing the best features of existing mechanical and chemical battery devices presently in use\n\nOXTO plans to become a full global energy management services company with ability to shift storage loads dynamically between multiple flywheel installations to rapidly meet changing customer demand and optimise system efficiency\n",
