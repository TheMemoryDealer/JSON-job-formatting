  "description": "Vivid revolutionises how content creators get rewarded for live streaming. Incumbents take 50% from creators revenues, depriving them of $1.5bn earnings per year. With Vivid, creators can answer user requests or set terms for their own content. This method allows users to get paid fairly rather than having to resort to clickbait tactics to entice viewers with a cluttered ad-driven experience.\n\nWe are also creating standalone tools to enhance Web Monetisation tech incl. 1) enabling users to stream micropayments P2P with a crypto address-free interface using $ and usernames & 2) pooling & splitting payments e.g. top sharers of quality content get rewarded.",
