We work with large organisations worldwide in healthcare, financial services, telecommunications, pharma and government, enabling them to get the most out of data without compromising on privacy. Backed by world-leading venture capital funds who’ve invested in high-growth companies like Facebook, Slack, Dropbox, Atlassian and Spotify, we have just completed a $80 million Series C funding round, and are in a phase of hyper-growth.\n\nWe believe that a great user experience is at the heart of any successful product. This is especially true in the emerging field of Data Privacy. This is an urgent, new problem in our data-driven society, and calls for a new approach to how data is used. We’re creating novel software to solve this problem, and our goal is to make it easy for enterprises to cut through the complexity and do the right thing by their customers, while continuing to innovate with data. \n\nAs a Product Designer we want you to be a driving force in gathering insight into our users' needs, behaviours and intentions. You'll translate this into interface designs which make a subtle and complex problem easy to manage.  \n\nYou will be a key member of the product team, responsible for product design and user experience, working closely with customers, engineers and product managers throughout all stages of the product cycle.\n\nWe are looking for a product designer passionate about crafting elegant practical experiences and clear interfaces with pixel perfect precision that solve real world user problems in data protection and security. You understand the critical role design plays within a users experience and its relationship to business goals. You are goal oriented and think about the wider picture collaborating well with cross discipline team members. You have a strong grounding in user centered design process (UCD) showing huge empathy for the audience and continually seek feedback for improvement.
