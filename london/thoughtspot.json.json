Develop and grow leaders to continue pushing the boundaries of engineering excellence and execution\n- Collaborate closely with other functions and teams, to continue innovating in user experience and building best-in-class software systems powering them\n- Help evolve a culture of selfless excellence in which each person does the best work of their lives and amplifies everyone around them\n- Lead technical direction, quality and execution for the application layer at Thoughtspot.\n\n**You know you are the right person, if you:**\n\n- Are an engineer at heart and crave putting imagination in action. You likely have 15+ years of experience crafting world-class products and building robust, high performance and intelligent systems for them\n- Have expertise in one or more areas like building and scaling web apps, UI Engineering, Information Visualization, Machine Learning etc.\n- Have provided senior technical leadership at the highest levels in a strong engineering culture.
