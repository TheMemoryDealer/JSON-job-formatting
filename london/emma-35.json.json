These are the three pillars on which we want to build a strong tech culture and fix personal finance once for all. üí™</p>\n\n<p>We have recently closed a seed round with Kima Ventures, one of the first in Transferwise, and Agla√© Ventures, early stage fund of the Groupe Arnault, investor in Netflix and Airbnb. Alongside them, several angel investors, who have built and sold industry leading companies have decided to take part into this journey. üöÄ</p>\n\n<p>Responsibilities</p>\n\n<p>Your focus will be on our mobile app! We have an intense roadmap ahead, which includes a plethora of new features and integrations, which you will be part of. </p>\n\n<p>Our tech stack</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Google Cloud</li>\n<li>MySQL</li>\n<li>Node.js</li>\n<li>Kubernetes</li>\n<li>Docker</li>\n<li>Redis</li>\n<li>React Native</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Some of our current interests lie in:</p>\n\n<p>üõ† Product: We are building the 1st Finance App in the UK, used by thousands of people every day.

This means an intense effort and quality in the work we do. </p>\n\n<p>üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Speed: In this industry what really matters is speed.
