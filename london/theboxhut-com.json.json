  "slogan": "A Subscription Box Marketplace",
  "description": "Theboxhut.com is an upcoming Marketplace for Subscription boxes. We allow suppliers to list their subscription boxes, and manage customers orders, and connect them to a new source of customers looking to try and experience new things. They will be able to purchase multiple boxes, as well as pause or cancel in one click, so no need to go through phone calls, surveys, or back and forth emails with customer support. The idea is to develop a service thats intuitive and simple for customers, yet still provides suppliers with a new sales channel, and access to new data sources.",
