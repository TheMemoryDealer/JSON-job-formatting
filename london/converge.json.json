  "description": "Converge’s mission is to make Industry efficient, safe and sustainable by bringing data driven decision making to the worksite. We engineer reliable, massively scaleable and well designed hardware and software products that make it easy to deploy wireless sensor networks and analyse the physical data they produce. We are convincing the world’s largest, most traditional and risk-averse industrial companies to embrace IoT. \n \nOur immediate focus has been to help civil engineers on construction sites better monitor concrete strength. Over the last two years, Converge has deployed thousands of sensors across the UK, helping hundreds of engineers do their job more efficiently, and building deep insight and expertise in the construction industry by connecting the physical environment. Lagging construction productivity currently costs the global economy over $1.6 trillion every year. Our technology is already having a huge impact on some of the UK’s largest infrastructure projects.\n",
