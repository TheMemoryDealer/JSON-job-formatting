  "description": "TIFY is a data science startup revolutionising the way businesses execute market sentiment analysis. Founded by a computer scientist with experience in marketing, TIFY has now grown its team and built a proprietary software which helps brands manage their online reputation, generate real-time consumer insights, and identify new market trends. With an expanding data science analytics market predicted to reach a size of US $ 203 billion by 2024, TIFY has already entered the space by delivering value to companies like Juventus F.C. and MAMOQ. Our competitive advantage lies in our state of the art technology which makes the product stand out from the competition in terms of usability and cost. Driven by the vision of an ethical and reliable use of AI, we built TIFY with the goal of giving the power of data science to everyone. With TIFY, sentiment analysis is as easy as a Google search. \n\nWe are part of the King's 20 Accelerator 2018/19 cohort, and the Google for Startups program. ",
