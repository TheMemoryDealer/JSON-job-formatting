  "description": "At Farewill, we’re out to change the way the world deals with death, helping people to take control, personally and financially, of what matters to them after they’re gone.\n\nWe launched our first product - our will-writing service - in December 2016, and since then we’ve grown to be the largest will-writer in the UK. We launched our second product, Probate, in early 2019, and recently our third, Cremation.\n\nIn the last 12 months, we’ve raised over £100M for charity, been on the front page of a national newspaper, averaged 4.9/5 on Trustpilot, grew the team from 15 to over 50, and formed major national partnerships with organisations across the charity, insurance, and mortgage industries.\n\nBased in a beautiful office by the canal in Haggerston (East London), we’re backed by some of Europe’s most exceptional investors - from the founders of Transferwise and Zoopla, to Kindred Capital, SAATCHiNVEST, JamJar and DMGT.",

By blending smart technology with outstanding customer service, we’re making everything to do with death easier, faster and fairer for people all over the UK.\n\nThis is an enormous market with the opportunity to change the lives of millions of people and their families every year.\n\nAs General Manager, you’ll be responsible for our Wills business - the most established, and largest, of our business units. Since launching in December 2016, we've grown to be the largest will-writer in the UK, and won 'National Will Writing Firm of the Year' at the British Wills & Probate Awards. But we're not stopping there.\n\nAs the Wills General Manager, you’ll own its strategy, growth, and operations (including full P&L ownership) and be instrumental in taking it from £3m in revenue to £30m (and beyond).\n\n**Why this role?**\n\nWe’re looking for somebody exceptional to join our team, and here's why we think this role is a great opportunity for the right person:\n\n1. Make a huge, irreversible impact on the industry: We’re committed to building products and services that transform the industry forever. Right now it’s characterised by exploitative prices and high-street solicitors, and people deserve better. We grew to be the UK’s biggest will writer in 18 months - and we’re not going to stop there, whether through other products that help people plan for death, new geographies, or both.\n2. Work with passionate people: We’re a diverse team with shared goals and divergent perspectives - we’re all pulling in the same direction but each bring something different to the table, whether in Ops, Product, Brand or Partnerships.\n3. Join at a really exciting time: we want to turbo-charge growth in wills, and we want to do it now. You’ll have the resources and support you need to do that - from building the team to launching marketing campaigns. We’re backed by some of the best investors in the UK (from the founders of Transferwise and Zoopla, to Augmentum, Kindred, JamJar and SAATCHiNVEST), we’re growing at pace, leading our market, and working on a fascinating area of life that often gets overlooked.\n\n###   \n\n### Company Mission\n\nTo change the way the world deals with death.\n\nAll of us are going to die. It’s a fundamental, tragic, romantic part of what it is to be human - but the industry that sits on top of it isn’t designed to help us make the most of it. We challenge the status quo by building great product experiences that make dealing with death simpler, more personal, fairly-priced & accessible to everyone.\n\nWe believe that by equipping people to navigate some of life’s hardest moments, we bring families together, help individuals face up to the fact that they’re going to die, and make life, while it lasts, more meaningful.\n\n**What’ll you do as General Manager (Wills) in your first 12 months**\n\n- Own the strategy and growth of our Wills business (including full P&L ownership)\n- Hit our growth plans, whilst keeping margins high\n- Work with product, sales, and operations to deliver a truly differentiated customer experience for people dealing with Wills \n- Work with marketing and partnerships to own the UK Wills market - including leaving no stone unturned in terms of how we acquire customers \n- Get stuck into the nitty-gritty of Wills and other adjacent products and services - and really understand what’s involved in helping customers\n- Work with our partners including contributing to commercial negotiations and contracts \n- Communicate the vision and goals for the Wills business to the rest of Farewill, our Board, and investors \n- Be part of our Leadership Team and report to our COO, Constance\n\n**Requirements**\n\nHopefully you'll have some or all of the following:\n\n- You’re a strategic thinker and exceptional problem solver - comfortable with the big-picture, whilst not afraid to get stuck into the details \n- You’re an excellent communicator - you can distill complex problems into intelligible concepts and communicate your ideas clearly \n- You’re analytical, and you track and measure everything. You test ideas and hypotheses and are quick to spot when something isn’t working\n- You’re goal-oriented - you’re not afraid of ambitious goals (in fact you prefer it that way) and you rally the people around you to hit them. You celebrate successes and learn (don’t hide) from failures\n- You’re able to prioritise and work well under pressure\n- Bonus (not requirement): you’ve owned a P&L, managed a large project, or launched a business or product of your own\n- Bonus (not requirement): you’ve managed a team, or been part of a Leadership Team before\n- Bonus (not requirement): you've seen a company scale to 150+ people \n\n*If this sounds like what you’d love to be doing, we can’t wait to hear from you. If you love the role but don’t know if you’re a 100% match then still get in touch, we value attitude and propensity to learn above roles in a CV.*\n\n**Benefits**\n\n- Join a fast-growing, creative, multi-disciplinary team of people who love what we do\n- The chance to make a meaningful contribution to people's lives and deaths\n- Competitive salary and generous stock options\n- 28 days of annual leave plus the usual public holidays\n- Work from home on Wednesdays, flexible start and end to your day\n- Off-site days and team lunches\n- Santander cycles membership!\nFor more info on Farewill have a read [here](https://farewill.workable.com/) or on our [blog](https://farewill.com/blog)",
