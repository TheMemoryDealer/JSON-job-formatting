  "description": "We've created the world's first homeseekers' portal.  Not heard of that term before?  That's because we had to invent it :)\nThink about how a property portal works and then think about the inverse of that?  \n\nConsumers use us to avoid searching through fake or old property adverts, to connect to the best real estate agents and to get them to match their properties to their search criteria.  Real Estate agents use us because they can now be proactive and match people to more of their properties.",
