  "description": "Streetbees is a London-based global intelligence platform that reveals how people behave, and why, by analysing real-life moments collected from its worldwide users on an always-on basis.\n \nOver 2 million users – or ‘bees’ – across 150 countries worldwide use the chat-style Streetbees app to share moments from their daily lives via videos, photos and text, giving as much or as little information as they like. Through applying advanced natural language processing technology to the results, Streetbees uncovers not just what they do, but also why they do it, and what drives them – and predicts what they may do next.\n \nThis allows Streetbees’ customers – who include Unilever, PepsiCo, BBC World Service, Vodafone and L’Oreal – to receive rich insights into communities anywhere in the world at an unprecedented scale and affordable cost, helping them deeply understand new or unfamiliar markets.
