  "slogan": "Build or buy online community experiences that are positive, customisable and cost-effective",
  "description": "We are a passionate community with over 20 years experience of building #onlinecommunities for some of the world's leading brands such as Telefonica, Sony Computer Entertainment, Airbnb and giffgaff.\n\nWe noticed that during the course of building Standing on Giants we came across many great young companies that had a community vision but were just too early in their journey to need or afford Standing on Giants products and services. Their technology requirements were for a product/service with a simpler and lighter feature set. Something that was incredibly flexible, easy to configure, and even gave the ability to integrate that community into existing systems.\n\nOur challenge, at Giants Technology, was to create something that was not only all of those things but something that was affordable. Something that could be up and running in a couple of hours, with ready to use API's for quick and seamless integration, without the need for any extra development from us, handing control back to the customer.\n\nSo that’s what we've done. We are very excited to announce we have a working web version, and a #Unity SDK version, ready to use from May 2020. Both versions run off the same core engine and are accessible from either environment at the same time!",
