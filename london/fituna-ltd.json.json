  "description": "Here at FITUNA, we are building a community for women to feel inspired, confident and motivated to be their best selves.\n\nOne of the main reasons influencers use their Instagram is to inspire people, to spread positive messages and to ultimately help as many people as they can reach.\n\nFITUNA shares that common goal. FITUNA was started by someone who wanted to improve their lifestyle and was a little overwhelmed with where to start. Looking to Instagram, influencers helped the founder change her life. Now, we want that to be available to women globally.\n\nFITUNA is an online catalog of products, each of which has been recommended by an influencer in the health + fitness industry. These products lye within clothing, shoes, equipment, beauty and nutrition. \n\nWomen browse through our products, understanding who has recommended them and why. This enables them to feel confident with their decision of which products will help them as an individual to achieve their health and fitness goals.",
