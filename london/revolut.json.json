We focus on community-driven and marketing-driven approaches to ensure our product is the preferred choice of the majority of people living in a target country or region.\nThe Growth department is constantly innovating and trying new ways to grow Revolut faster and more effectively. Each area of the team works like special forces: from acquisition to engagement, they own their markets, are passionate about Revolut, and use their know-how to grow the brand and our user base at breakneck speed.\n\nA LITTLE ABOUT US \nFrom clunky apps to hidden fees, banking is broken. So we decided to build a company from the ground that would challenge the bigger players and reinvent how people interact with their money — for the better. Traditional banks are slow and expensive. We use technology to deliver customer satisfaction in ways not possible in the old world.\n\nOUR CULTURE \nTo put it bluntly — it’s about getting shit done and owning what you do. We don’t hide behind fancy job titles or set up bureaucratic processes. Instead we treat our people equally, fairly and give them a ton of freedom and autonomy to create something awesome. We make mistakes, we learn from them and we back everything up with data and logic. In three years, we’ve grown to over 1000 people and we’re adding around 30 new additions each month.

Members of the team provide front-line guidance and support to all areas of the company, contributing to decisions that impact on Revolut’s growth every day.\nThe breadth of work you will encounter (and level of commercial involvement) is pretty unique for an in-house role, from structuring credit programmes to launching into new territories. We hire both generalists (typically corporate/commercial solicitors) as well as specialists (such as compliance), alongside operations analysts, all of whom have a large degree of responsibility for Revolut’s ongoing development and growth.\n\nABOUT THE ROLE\nThis is an exciting opportunity to take ownership of the credit product from a legal and regulatory perspective. Our innovative approaches to payments, coupled with an increasingly complex and demanding legal and regulatory environment, provide robust career opportunities for lawyers motivated and driven by a fast paced, cutting edge culture.

With data we build intelligent real-time systems to personalise our product, tackle financial crime, automate reporting, track team performances and enhance customer experiences.\nFundamentally, data underpins all operations at Revolut and being part of the team gives you the chance to have a major impact across the company – apply today to join our world class data department.\n\nABOUT THE ROLE\nYou will work with the Financial Crime - Transaction monitoring team. We are a full stack team of data engineers, data scientists, backend engineers and financial crime specialists who are solving some of the hardest anti-fraud and anti-money laundering problems in the world. Our team builds artificial intelligence (AI) driven systems that continuously learn anomalous patterns typical of fraud. In this regards, we need a senior data engineer to scale our various microservices and machine learning systems. If you love thinking analytically about big data computations at microsecond latencies, then this is your gig!\n\nWhat you'll be doing:\n-You will be responsible for writing scalable backend systems that use a machine learning model to score users in near real-time.\n-You will research and productionize stream processing algorithms that can efficiently compute various statistics (mean, standard deviation, percentiles) on a data stream. \n-You will work on a small team of other data engineers to standardize features across our many different models into a unified feature store. \n-At Revolut, our data and backend engineers are also responsible for “dev ops” of the systems they write and hence, you will be responsible for building and maintaining our Kubernetes based deployment pipeline along with pagerduty and alerting instrumentation. \n-Our data stack is based predominantly on Python on the backend with Exasol as our data warehouse. We are hosted on Google Cloud Platform and our data scientists and engineers rely heavily on DataFlow, Big Query, Composer and Apache Beam, for their machine learning pipelines.\n\n\nWHAT SKILLS YOU’LL NEED \n-Fluency with Python3 years (or more) experience in back-end development or data engineering\n-Bachelor’s Degree (or above) in Computer Science/Maths/Physics/similar\n-Previous background in working with machine learning or data engineering teams is a plus (not required)\n-Quick learner with an ambitious and results driven personality\n-Working well as part of a team in a fast-paced environment\n-Excellent communication and organisational skills\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA LITTLE ABOUT US\nWe believe that there are better ways for people to control their money. Easier, fairer ways. \nRevolut started in 2015 with fee-free card transactions abroad. We’ve since added current accounts, business accounts, savings, insurance, and even cryptocurrency trading.\nWe reached 4 million customers in February 2019 and we’re adding another million every quarter.\nAnd we’re only just getting started.\nCome and help Revolut build the world’s first truly global bank. \n\nWHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR\nFrom employee 1 to employee 1000, you will be slotting into a global team that shares a number of traits.\nYou can work autonomously and take ownership. We thrive with the space and responsibility to solve problems.\nYou operate best without lots of bureaucracy.

We are a full stack team of data engineers, data scientists, backend engineers and financial crime specialists who are solving some of the hardest anti-fraud and anti-money laundering problems in the world. Our team builds artificial intelligence (AI) driven systems that continuously learn anomalous patterns typical of fraud. In this regards, we need a senior data engineer to scale our various microservices and machine learning systems. If you love thinking analytically about big data computations at microsecond latencies, then this is your gig!</p>\n\n<p>What you&#39;ll be doing:<br>\n-You will be responsible for writing scalable backend systems that use a machine learning model to score users in near real-time.<br>\n-You will research and productionize stream processing algorithms that can efficiently compute various statistics (mean, standard deviation, percentiles) on a data stream. <br>\n-You will work on a small team of other data engineers to standardize features across our many different models into a unified feature store. <br>\n-At Revolut, our data and backend engineers are also responsible for “dev ops” of the systems they write and hence, you will be responsible for building and maintaining our Kubernetes based deployment pipeline along with pagerduty and alerting instrumentation. <br>\n-Our data stack is based predominantly on Python on the backend with Exasol as our data warehouse. We are hosted on Google Cloud Platform and our data scientists and engineers rely heavily on DataFlow, Big Query, Composer and Apache Beam, for their machine learning pipelines.</p>\n\n<p>WHAT SKILLS YOU’LL NEED <br>\n-Fluency with Python3 years (or more) experience in back-end development or data engineering<br>\n-Bachelor’s Degree (or above) in Computer Science/Maths/Physics/similar<br>\n-Previous background in working with machine learning or data engineering teams is a plus (not required)<br>\n-Quick learner with an ambitious and results driven personality<br>\n-Working well as part of a team in a fast-paced environment<br>\n-Excellent communication and organisational skills</p>\n\n<p>A LITTLE ABOUT US<br>\nWe believe that there are better ways for people to control their money.
