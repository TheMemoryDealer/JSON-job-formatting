  "description": "ComplyAdvantage is helping firms rethink how they combat financial crime and comply with regulations (specifically around Sanctions, AML and CTF). The team is on a personal mission to combat the rising threat of terrorism and fight the negative impact on society of money laundering.\n\nComplyAdvantage's proprietary, dynamic global database of individuals, organisations and all their connections, provides fresh insight into financial crime risks (e.g. Sanctions, Watchlists, Politically Exposed Persons, Adverse Media). ComplyAdvantage's screening platform helps to safely automate the risk assessment of customers and transactions, and their real-time analytics enable firms to monitor customer activity and spot suspicious behaviours.\n\nComplyAdvantage uses machine learning and big data coupled with a tailored risk-based approach to help a wide range of insurance companies and financial institutions improve automation, reduce manual work (‘false positives’) and make decisions faster.",

We are a venture-backed startup using artificial intelligence to fight terrorism and financial crime. We have a desire to reduce crime and criminal activity through the creative use of technology and to disrupt the compliance industry while doing so.\n\nWe are a SaaS-first company with development, QA and production systems all deployed on AWS.
