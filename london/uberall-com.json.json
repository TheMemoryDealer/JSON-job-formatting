  "slogan": "Changing How Businesses Around the World Connect With Nearby Consumers",
  "description": "We help companies gain greater control over their online presence and reputation with software solutions to deliver a memorable ‘Near Me’ Brand Experience — from online interactions to offline sales.\n\nAs a global SaaS provider, we build a bridge between the online and offline worlds. Our software solutions gives companies optimal online visibility — so businesses can easily connect with concumers at all the online touch points they have with the local outlets of a brand, from finding, persuading, buying and recommending, to returning as a regular customer.\n\n\n\nThe Founding Story\n\nLongtime friends and business partners David Federhen and Florian Hübner shared the vision to bridge the online and offline world more effectively, so companies could generate new customers, build customer relationships and increase their sales.\n\nThey created a platform that would connect companies with local customers through search and discovery, engagement and conversion — and in 2013, Uberall was born.\n\n\nWe Empower Your Business to Deliver Outstanding Experiences to Nearby Consumers\n\nThe rise of mobile search has been the game changer in recent marketing history, radically transforming consumer behaviour.\n\nToday’s consumers are accessing a vast digital ecosystem with their smartphones, laptops, watches, voice assistants and more. They search for a product or service on Google or Bing, look at other customers' reviews on Facebook or Trustpilot and ask their language assistant Siri or navigation device for the way to business.\n\nThe customer journey hasn't been linear for a long time — and if you want to win customers over, you have to provide a seamless user experience: on all devices, all search engines and all online platforms where customers search for companies.
