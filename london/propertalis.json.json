      "description": "We are looking for a Growth Marketer and Co-Funder who really understands all the moving pieces of modern web marketing, loves the transformations that tech is bringing in many aspects of our lives and wants to play an active role in disrupting property business. \r\n\r\n**About Propertalis**\r\n\r\nWe’re preparing to launch a business and platform to connect London property owners directly with highly skilled and motivated freelance estate agents. \r\n \r\nHigh Street and online agencies are all good at marketing and sales, but the quality of their service is variable and it’s hard for consumers to tell the good from the bad until it’s too late. We believe many agencies don’t pay their agents enough to attract and retain the best talent and don’t incentivise them to get the best results for their clients. People are basically entrusting their most valuable asset to a somewhat unskilled and unmotivated agent.\r\n \r\nWe believe the most experienced and skilled agents should go freelance. They will be highly motivated by the prospect of earning all of their client’s commission. Clients can choose exactly who they want to work with. They can get excellent service and results, without paying any more than they would on the High Street. \r\n \r\nOur platform helps clients hire the right freelance agent to sell, let or manage their property. It also uses technology to support the wholesales or letting process, simplifying tasks and keeping them both fully informed every step of the way. \r\n \r\nThe two current co-founders are both working full-time on this opportunity, although one of them also runs a successful property management business. Their backgrounds are in real estate, law, software, sales and product management. But we’re both generalists, who are incredibly energised by the potential of this business. \r\n \r\n\r\n* About the Opportunity*\r\n\r\nThe position is about marketing our services and brand. You will help our business scale by applying your marketing skills to support the growth process. You will work together with our Sales team so they can reach out to new leads which you helped to generate.\r\n\r\nThis is a start up so the list of duties and responsibilities will be very dynamic based on actual needs but these are the most important aspects you’ll be working on:\r\n\r\nCreating and applying a Growth Strategy \r\nPreparing and managing  campaigns\r\nManaging and Creating Content (web,letters, blog, posters, brochures, etc.)\r\nManaging and Creating CTA's\r\nWriting, sending and analysing emails \r\nManaging and creating gated content\r\nGrow and manage social networks accounts\r\nCreate a community of techie property owners\r\nPlay an active commentator role on property topics all around the internet.\r\n\r\nPart of recruiting will be a test of your skills that will demand a couple of days of your time, do not apply if you are not willing to do that. \r\n\r\n*What We’re Looking For*\r\n\r\nWe’re looking for someone with experience in growth marketing and startups.  Chemistry is a big thing for us, so we’re looking for someone who is passionate about Proptech and really shares our vision. We are also looking for someone who: \r\n \r\nhas been successful before on doing this role in a startup preferably.\r\nis ‘hungry’ for a big change in her life and wants to make an impact. \r\nis DO_ER, ideas and discussions are useless without execution.  \r\n \r\n \r\nTo Apply \r\n \r\nIf you’ve made it this far and are still interested in working with us, then we want to hear from you.
