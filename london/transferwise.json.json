There’s no corporate nonsense, and no old-fashioned hierarchy. Instead, we work in dozens of self-sufficient, autonomous teams. Think of them like start-ups within a start-up that learn from each other.</p>\n\n<p>Each team picks the problems they want to solve. So there’s no micro-management. No hiding behind fancy job titles. And no one telling you what to do. You are your own boss. But you’ll get tons of guidance and plenty of support from talented, super-smart colleagues from all over TransferWise.</p>\n\n<p>We’re going to be upfront — the way we work doesn’t suit everyone. But if freedom, autonomy, and life-affirming, head-scratching professional challenges rock your world, we could be a match made in heaven.</p>\n\n<p>Product engineers only</p>\n\n<p>Here at TransferWise we don’t hire coders, who pick up tickets from a backlog and push code to production without considering value and impact.</p>\n\n<p>What you’ll be working on:</p>\n\n<p>TransferWise is complex under the hood, but we’re just getting started. With our own payment rails, there are lots of opportunities to build new products and services on them. At its core, our stack is Java microservices, using Netflix OSS offerings, and SPAs written in Angular 1/React, with a legacy Grails monolith. We are moving quickly to proven distributed technologies that can be scaled (Kafka, Zookeeper, Eureka, Bouncer +  much more)<br>\nMore details: <a href=\"http://tech.transferwise.com/the-transferwise-stack-heartbeat-of-our-little-revolution/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://tech.transferwise.com/the-transferwise-stack-heartbeat-of-our-little-revolution/</a></p>\n\n<p>Integrating with a variety of partners and providers across the world, so our customers can send money across borders with minimal fuss and maximum confidence. Getting to the core of the customer’s problems by conducting interviews, answering support and figure out what TransferWise is to the customer and how it can be improved.</p>\n\n<p>What do you want to be working on? Autonomous teams come up with their own plans, there is no hierarchy telling you what to do.</p>\n\n<p>Must haves:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Passionate about technology and its relationship with business and user experience.</li>\n<li>Ability to work independently and plan your own solutions to problems.</li>\n<li>Experience using a back-end MVC Frameworks.</li>\n<li>Experience with Java and Spring Boot preferred.</li>\n<li>Experience developing in HTML, CSS and JavaScript</li>\n<li>Experience developing in a modern front end framework, Angular.js is preferred, but experience with Backbone, Ember, Knockout or React is also relevant.</li>\n<li>Experience working with SQL databases, writing custom queries and designing schemas.</li>\n<li>Understanding of test driven development (TDD), the ability to structure your code so it’s testable, and the desire to write tests.</li>\n<li>Broad understanding of the concept of minimum viable product and conversion rates.</li>\n<li>Possess empathy for the user and able to build great code that drives fantastic user experience.</li>\n<li>Strong communication skills and ability to articulate complex and technical concepts to non-technical audiences.</li>\n<li>Be willing to travel, to work and learn with dev teams in Estonia and Ukraine.</li>\n<li>Excitement to work in a high-growth company, and throw themselves fully -\ninto a revolution.</li>\n<li>Be open, communicative, and fun to work with.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Nice to haves:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Understanding of Scrum and Agile development</li>\n<li>Experience using database abstraction layers like Hibernate.</li>\n<li>Be a customer of TransferWise</li>\n<li>Teamlead experience</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Benefits:</p>\n\n<p>Apart from the all-expenses-paid company trips, stock options in one of Europe’s most hotly tipped startups, a laptop and team lunches every other Thursday, you won’t get much in the way of extras. However, we will give you 28 days holiday a year (plus public holidays), a fun, friendly atmosphere, plenty of opportunities to grow and the chance to be part of our little revolution. Oh, and coffee, there’s plenty of coffee.</p>\n\n<p>Not from Estonia? - No stress, we will help you (and your family) to relocate from any part of the world!</p>\n",

      "description": "Are you the best product marketer in New York? We’d love to meet you.\n\nTransferWise was founded in 2011 with a clear mission — money without borders — instant, convenient, fair, and eventually free.  We built a market-leading technology product that’s been used by over 4 million people to move money around the world without the rip-off fees charged by the banks.\n\nWe have a market-leading money transfer product available across North American and Latin American markets. In 2019 we launched a new product in the U.S., the TransferWise debit card, to help customers send money, receive money and spend money in any currency in the world — without the rip-off fees. \n\nNow, we’re looking for a world-class consumer Product Marketing Manager to join our New York office to drive adoption of TransferWise products to customers across the Americas.\n\nIt’s not just being able to deliver on insight, value props, messaging and go-to-market – we’re looking for someone with the magic touch that takes the delivery of our marketing from good, to blow-your-mind brilliant. We want every TransferWise user to feel like we built the product just for them — that we’re not only right up their street, but invited in, sitting down at the kitchen table with a cup of coffee like old friends. \n\nOn the day to day, the North America PMM will be responsible for insight, messaging, multi-channel product comms, and working with the team to build tools and run experiments to constantly improve product adoption and the customer experience. You’ll drive cross-sell conversion, onboarding funnel optimisation, activation and usage KPIs. \n\nYou’ll own the go-to-market strategy for new currency, product and feature launches across the Americas, focussing primarily on the U.S. and Canadian markets. You’ll work closely with our global product marketing team based in London and Singapore to optimise global product adoption and deliver on team OKRs. \n\nYou’ll obsess over product economics, LTV and churn rate, continuously testing lifecycle marketing campaigns to increase share-of-wallet and reactivated customers.

      "descriptionHtml": "<p>Are you the best product marketer in New York? We’d love to meet you.</p>\n\n<p>TransferWise was founded in 2011 with a clear mission — money without borders — instant, convenient, fair, and eventually free.  We built a market-leading technology product that’s been used by over 4 million people to move money around the world without the rip-off fees charged by the banks.</p>\n\n<p>We have a market-leading money transfer product available across North American and Latin American markets. In 2019 we launched a new product in the U.S., the TransferWise debit card, to help customers send money, receive money and spend money in any currency in the world — without the rip-off fees. </p>\n\n<p>Now, we’re looking for a world-class consumer Product Marketing Manager to join our New York office to drive adoption of TransferWise products to customers across the Americas.</p>\n\n<p>It’s not just being able to deliver on insight, value props, messaging and go-to-market – we’re looking for someone with the magic touch that takes the delivery of our marketing from good, to blow-your-mind brilliant. We want every TransferWise user to feel like we built the product just for them — that we’re not only right up their street, but invited in, sitting down at the kitchen table with a cup of coffee like old friends. </p>\n\n<p>On the day to day, the North America PMM will be responsible for insight, messaging, multi-channel product comms, and working with the team to build tools and run experiments to constantly improve product adoption and the customer experience. You’ll drive cross-sell conversion, onboarding funnel optimisation, activation and usage KPIs. </p>\n\n<p>You’ll own the go-to-market strategy for new currency, product and feature launches across the Americas, focussing primarily on the U.S. and Canadian markets. You’ll work closely with our global product marketing team based in London and Singapore to optimise global product adoption and deliver on team OKRs. </p>\n\n<p>You’ll obsess over product economics, LTV and churn rate, continuously testing lifecycle marketing campaigns to increase share-of-wallet and reactivated customers. And in doing so, you’ll deliver the kind of marketing that makes your friends say, “I love the way TransferWise do stuff”. </p>\n\n<p>You’ll have the opportunity to travel and spend time in our London office and Headquarters in Tallinn, Estonia. You’ll also have the chance to take part in Summer Days, our annual company offsite in Estonia.
