A world where wine lovers are no longer intimidated or embarrassed with wine.**\r\n\r\nWine is the UK's most popular alcoholic drink, but for most people there are still barriers surrounding it. Knowledge is held by the 0.1% and we are aiming to end that. \r\n\r\nOur mission is to give confidence to wine lovers. We do this through three things:\r\n\r\n1. Provide access to knowledge: no-nonsense, concise lessons that are fun and engaging\r\n2. Share wines from around the world showcasing lesser-known grapes, regions, and styles\r\n3. Create a community of wine lovers who are all on the same journey to learn together\r\n\r\nWine List is right at the start of its journey. We sent out first box of wine in August 2019. And hired the first employee in March 2020. You will be joining at a critical time within the startup's journey.\r\n\r\nWine List suits smart, self-starters who are ambitious and motivated by working in a wine startup.\r\n\r\nEvery employee receives options so that we all grow together.\r\n\r\n### **About the role**\r\n\r\nYour job will be to acquire over 5,000 customers in the next 12 months. How you achieve this will be up to you.\r\n\r\nWe have acquired customers so far through three main channels: paid social, partnerships and referral. These channels may well form part of our long term acquisition mix, but we are open to all ideas that could get us there.\r\n\r\nIt is still early days for Wine List. These first customers will be formative in understanding how we continue to improve the product, and will be vital to the company's survival and success.\r\n\r\nYou will be the second hire into the Wine List team, reporting directly in to the founder, and the first marketing hire. (Prior to launching Wine List, the founder had 10 years of marketing experience).\r\n\r\nWe are looking for skills over experience and therefore welcome applications from a widespread pool of backgrounds, professions, and jobs.\r\n\r\n### What we're looking for in you\r\n\r\n- [ ]  **Analytical**. You love data and build spreadsheets or databases for everything\r\n- [ ]  **Creative**. We don't have a creative team. This means ad creation is on you\r\n- [ ]  **Self-starter.** We are a tiny team in our first vital year: you must act quickly and independently\r\n- [ ]  **Get shit done**. Done is better than perfect. Automated is better than manual.\r\n- [ ]  **Entrepreneurial**. We want people who want to run their own companies one day\r\n- [ ]  **Humble with growth mindset**. We get more wrong than right &amp; you must relish learning from that\r\n- [ ]  **Technical-ish**. We don't need an engineer, but solid experience of automation tools, computer science principles, and data structures will help you stand out.\r\n\r\n### What you'll get in return\r\n\r\n- A competitive salary, recognising we're in our first year\r\n- Generous stock options\r\n- 28 days holiday per year\r\n- Wine perks: access to tastings, education, and winemaker days where we learn to make wine\r\n- Flexible working, but with a HQ office in Peckham, South London\r\n- Access to a wide selection of marketing mentors\r\n\r\n### **How to apply**\r\n\r\nVisit this page and apply: https://www.notion.so/thewinelist/Acquisition-growth-marketing-manager-074659a6bffb4757b47b0177edc7777b\r\n\r\nTo apply, you need to provide your CV or LinkedIn, three bulletpoints (no more than 250 words) on why you're right for the role, and one reason why you want the job. \r\n\r\n**The interview process** \r\n\r\n1.
