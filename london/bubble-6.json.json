  "description": "At bubble we’re on a mission to make parents happier. We do this by using technology to solve their biggest daily pain point – access to great childcare. Our on-demand childcare app uses social data to connect parents with carers already used within their trusted personal networks. We’re using innovative technology to digitise trust and deliver exceptional and impactful customer experiences.\n\nEvery month more than 10,000 childcare requests get sent out over bubble – traction achieved from strong word-of-mouth and limited marketing activity. Our customers love and are passionate about what we do (check us out on Trustpilot) and our investors founded some of the UK’s biggest digital success stories, such as Betfair, Boohoo and Photobox. \n",
