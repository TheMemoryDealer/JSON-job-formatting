  "description": "Tech Against Terrorism is an initiative launched and supported by UN CTED that works with tech companies and startups to build capacity for preventing their platforms from exploitation by terrorists and violent extremists. At the core of it all is a focus on respecting human rights and freedom of speech.\n\nThis work feeds into our development of an online knowledge-sharing platform that will form a resource freely accessible to all organisations seeking help and guidance. All our work advocates the strengths of an industry-led, self-regulatory approach to tackling terrorist use of technology, and is informed by the emerging normative framework spearheaded by major technology companies. \n\nAlong with UN CTED, we are collaborating with Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter, and YouTube to support the recently-announced industry-led Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism.
