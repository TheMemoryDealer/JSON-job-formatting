  "description": "The Compound FX trading system is a highly specialist compound positioning, hedging and trading algorithm; it is an automated system that is overseen and managed by dedicated and experienced professionals of the highest calibre.\n\nThe program trades on pre-defined currency pairs.\n\nIt has many parameters that are required to be met before it will place a trade.\n\nThese include:\nVOLUME AND LIQUIDITY\nMARKET TREND\nINSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT AND RESISTANCE LEVELS\n\nThe most advanced aspect of the program is its ability to compound position and hedge a negative position to close out in profit. This ensures that drawdown is not recorded as a loss on the account, but only holds a negative position.\n\nThese positions will always close out in profit because the algorithm will calculate new positions at key levels, which have a higher leverage. This allows a profitable outcome when the market retraces.",
