  "slogan": "Cloud-based, cross-border, currency exchange solution",
  "description": "Our primary product at VPFX is a dual cloud-based payments solution. Our clients receive exceptional currency exchange rates for their personal or business transactions, typically beating their current provider by up to 5%. We use SWIFT GPI, localised currency accounts, and two of the worlds largest Investment Banks to ensure transactions are secure, fast, and efficient. Our clients have access to their own E-Wallet; where they can store, exchange, send/receive, or hedge currency instantly.\n\nOur primary customers are businesses exchanging & transacting currency as part of their day-to-day operations. Whether this is a small 'mom-&-pop' shop in the USA purchasing products from China, or a U.K. based mining company paying its employees in South Africa. Our consultants also provide a personal, almost concierge-like service for HNW/UHNW's who require large transactions processed.",
