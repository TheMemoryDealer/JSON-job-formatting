The instructions are generated by real time analysis of data generated from the Carv pressure and motion inserts, which retrofit into any ski boot.\r\n\r\nDeveloped alongside Olympians and the Professional Ski Instructors of America, Carv’s post-run analysis gives an overall Ski:IQ™, which compares your ability against the rest of the Carv community, allowing skiers to compete with family, friends and even professionals. \r\n\r\n**Advisors and investors include:**\r\n* SOS Ventures\r\n* Virgin\r\n* Steve Rechtschaffner (former CCO of EA Games Canada, creator of SSX Tricky and US Freestyle team member)\r\n* Jeremy Bloom (3x World Champion, 2x Olympian, and 11x World Cup Gold Medalist)\r\n\r\n**Here’s what the press are saying:**\r\n\r\n* “*The biggest testament to Carv’s coaching abilities is that I could see my skiing improving in only a few hours.*” - 5* review in Stuff Magazine\r\n* “*Carv is surprisingly addictive*” - Financial Times\r\n* \"*The speed with which real-time coaching was ironing out the wrinkles in my technique was striking.

      "descriptionHtml": "<p>At MotionMetrics, we’re working to create digital sports coaching experiences. Our first product is <a href=\"https://www.getcarv.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Carv</a>, a digital skiing coach that blends hardware, software and real-time audio instruction to teach people the sport of skiing - a world first across sports.</p>\n\n<p>We’ve shipped 12,000 units to date and are doubling production every year to keep up with demand. This is an outstanding opportunity to work in a fast growing sports technology start-up in London, alongside a fantastic team of hardware and software engineers, marketing and customer service experts who are all passionate about changing the paradigm of coaching.</p>\n<h3>More information about Carv</h3>\n<p>After breaking the Kickstarter sports wearables record in 2016, Carv launched in 2017 and has since coached thousands of skiers.</p>\n\n<p>Carv provides detailed post-run analysis as well as real-time audio instruction as you ski. The instructions are generated by real time analysis of data generated from the Carv pressure and motion inserts, which retrofit into any ski boot.</p>\n\n<p>Developed alongside Olympians and the Professional Ski Instructors of America, Carv’s post-run analysis gives an overall Ski:IQ™, which compares your ability against the rest of the Carv community, allowing skiers to compete with family, friends and even professionals. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Advisors and investors include:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>SOS Ventures</li>\n<li>Virgin</li>\n<li>Steve Rechtschaffner (former CCO of EA Games Canada, creator of SSX Tricky and US Freestyle team member)</li>\n<li>Jeremy Bloom (3x World Champion, 2x Olympian, and 11x World Cup Gold Medalist)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Here’s what the press are saying:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>“<em>The biggest testament to Carv’s coaching abilities is that I could see my skiing improving in only a few hours.</em>” - 5* review in Stuff Magazine</li>\n<li>“<em>Carv is surprisingly addictive</em>” - Financial Times</li>\n<li>&quot;<em>The speed with which real-time coaching was ironing out the wrinkles in my technique was striking. There’s no other way to get feedback quite like this. Instructors can only give you a debrief after your descent — and even then it will be based on what they suppose is going on in your boots. Carv’s coaching comes straight from the sole.</em>&quot; - Sunday Times</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>About the role</h3>\n<p>Over the past three ski seasons, we’ve collected terabytes of skiing data covering tens of millions of skiing turns and user instructions.
