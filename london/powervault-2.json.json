We believe in a 100% clean energy system, and our mission is to make this possible by maximising home energy flexibility. We design and develop advanced home energy storage devices that help our customers reduce their bills and carbon emissions by maximising on-site use of solar ad low cost electricity from the grid. We also provide the software that allows our partners to remotely operate thousands of Powervault devices to provide services to the electricity markets and grid.\n\nThis is an opportunity to work in one of the fastest growing areas of the internet of things: energy storage and smart grid technology. We have recently secured investment and need to grow the team as we ramp up production and continue to develop the functionality of our product and infrastructure. We are a young company with a growing team, based in London Bridge in a unique working environment in the largest cluster of sustainability-focused start-ups in Europe.
