  "description": "At Tessian we have built our technology to empower people to work safely, without security getting in their way. We believe people shouldn’t have to be security experts to do their jobs. Our Human Layer Security platform automatically protects employees from risks like data exfiltration, accidental data loss and phishing. \n\nWe believe people are the most important decision makers in any organisation. We’re a group of data scientists, engineers, designers, creative thinkers and commercial experts that are passionate about protecting people processing data in the enterprise. \n\nWe’ve raised $60m from security investors Sequoia, Accel and Balderton who have helped build many industry defining companies including Stripe, Slack, Crowdstrike and Dropbox and have two office locations in both London and San Francisco. \n\nWe would love to hear from you.\n",
