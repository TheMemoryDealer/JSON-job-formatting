  "description": "Simply Business exists to make significant positive changes to the insurance industry.\n\nAs insurance is an industry heavily focused on tradition rather than innovation; Simply Business goes against the industry grain by doing the exact opposite.\n\nIn addition to pioneering the use of mobile tech for insurance, we've built a digital brokerage platform with the customer's interests at the forefront. Customers can purchase the best-suited policy without being misled or confused by insurance jargon.",

Our PaaS built on cloud infrastructure is our product and the rest of the business our customers.\n\nYou will be hands on in creating solutions to build and automate environments for production use.

We look at the highest pain points for both dev and ops and work backwards.
