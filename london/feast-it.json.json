  "description": "Feast It is changing the global events industry for the better. We have built a curated platform connecting the best suppliers to the most exciting events, from dinner parties for 20 right up to the UK’s largest festivals. We believe that every event deserves incredible food, drink and entertainment and we are building the technology to unlock it for everyone.\n\nWe’ve built an incredible community of the nation’s finest event suppliers, from independent photographers, mixologists, and videographers, to the finest chefs and restaurants in the world such Nobu, Bao, and Honest Burger. And yes the job involves free food and tickets to events...\n\nOnly three years into our journey, we’ve worked with everyone from Amazon, Nike, and London Pride, to Tom Cruise, Star Wars, and Taylor Swift and have seen nothing but rapid growth. We recently came #17 in the Startups 100 awards, were finalists in the 2019 Natwest Entrepreneur Awards and have been named in the top 15 in Tempo’s 50 Best Places to Work. Our team is expanding, our office keeps growing and we’ve fed millions of people at events over the last few years!\n\nIf you’re a hungry, ambitious, status-quo challenging self-starter looking to change an industry, you’ll fit right in and Feast It wants to hear from you.",
