In order to scale and make an impact we need a world-class team to help us make a difference in critical but slow moving industries.\r\n\r\n**Are you the one who can forever change the transport and infrastructure industries forever?**\r\n\r\nYou will be at the heart of a truly unique movement that will have a massive impact within the UK economy. \r\n\r\nWe are looking for a Senior Data Scientist to lead the analysis, modelling and visualisation of signalling and train performance data with the aim of reducing train delays and improving network capacity (more trains on the UK railway network). To do so, you will work closely with the UK railway operational performance teams to extract valuable insights from previously unused data.\r\n\r\nAs a Senior Data Scientist you will be responsible for developing algorithms that merge, aggregate and visualise complex signalling &amp; train movement data, obtained from disparate sources.
