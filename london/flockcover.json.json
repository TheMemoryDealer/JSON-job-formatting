  "description": "Flock is a London-based, VC- and Government-backed insurtech startup, pioneering the use of Big Data to intelligently price insurance. Flock has formed a global partnership with Allianz, the world's largest aviation insurer, to launch their first product 'Flock Cover': a pay-as-you-fly insurance and safety app for drone pilots.\n\nFlock recently closed a £2.25M Seed round led by Anthemis, alongside Silicon Valley's Plug and Play, Seed and Speed, and London VC Downing Ventures (who are re-investing having led Flock's pre-seed round in 2016) and a syndicate of highly specialised angels. In addition, Flock has been awarded grants from Innovate UK, the Ordnance Survey, Slaughter and May and Norton Rose Fulbright.\n\nFlock is building partnerships with global insurers, expanding its London tech team, and gearing up to launch its drone insurance platform internationally. \n",
