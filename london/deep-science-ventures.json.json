  "description": "Deep Science Ventures was founded to create a better method for applied science, one that is business-minded and focused on opportunity discovery. Rather than build companies on the back of IP that is hot or on-trend, we start by identifying pivotal problems and crucial opportunities.\n\nThen, our global network of founder-type scientists build “holy grail” ventures that have the potential to redesign entire sectors. \n\nWe are a team of uncompromising scientists at the intersection of scientific expertise and possibility. We are intrinsically driven to leave the world a better place than we found it. After spending 10 years in university tech transfer, venture studios, and corporate innovation arms, we’ve developed a better framework to scale the impact of science.\n\nTo learn more or join us, please visit: www.deepscienceventures.com.",
