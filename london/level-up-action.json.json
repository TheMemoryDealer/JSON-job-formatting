  "description": "Using digital tools and tactics, we mobilise thousands of feminists from across the UK to take action on the issues that matter to them - and win. So far this has included petitions to the press regulator calling for more sensitive reporting on domestic violence, and e-mailing ITV directors to take plastic surgery ads off-air. \n\nThe job is as flexible and creative as you are!",
