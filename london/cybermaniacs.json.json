We'll need you to wear an architecture hat, sorting out the best ways across web technologies and data back ends to weave it together (plus some random fun side projects with the creative side of our enterprise and the streamlining/automation projects of our business operations). Since we're still pretty young and scrappy, there will be lots of projects that may require you to put hands to keyboards to get-it-done, growing your team as we scale. Finally, having the ability to reach out to our customers and prospects to guide product development and being a great listener would ice the cake. \nWe'd love to hear about how you could help us grow, what kind of problems do you like to solve? How flexible is your current life, and why do you want to be a part of our company? We're all about finding a great cultural fit, as you'll be a strategic hire for us and the whole mesh-with-us-vibe must be strong. You'll be getting in at the 'almost' ground level, so there is much room to grow and design, develop and learn... and great financial upside as we have the potential to deliver our solution to millions. Come on in and see what the fuzz is all about. \nAll the Best, \nTeam CM",
