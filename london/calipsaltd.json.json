  "slogan": "Deep learning powered false alarm filter for security monitoring",
  "description": "With a mission to improve the detection and prevention of crime, Calipsa's cloud-based False Alarm Filtering Platform uses deep learning technology to filter out over 85% of CCTV false alarms. Calipsa recognises the cause of an alarm, filtering out those that are not caused by human of vehicle motion - anything from a spider, to foliage, or the weather - forwarding only genuine alarms to human operators to review.\n\nAs leaders in false alarm reduction, Calipsa is revolutionising false alarm management and video monitoring efficiency for security monitoring companies, integrators and installers.",
