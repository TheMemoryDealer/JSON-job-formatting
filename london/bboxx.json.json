There is a growing need for research into innovative solutions for making clean cooking fuels accessible.\n\nThis research will build on the innovative work of BBOXX (https://www.bboxx.co.uk/ (https://workable.com/nr?l=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bboxx.co.uk%2F) ), a next generation utility unlocking potential through energy access. With headquarters in London and operations in 12 countries including Rwanda, Kenya, Togo, DRC and Pakistan BBOXX offers pay-as-you-go solar power. At the heart of BBOXX is their pioneering management platform, called Pulse, which continuously collects data and insights.

      "descriptionHtml": "<p>Lack of energy access in sub-Saharan Africa is a significant problem, with more than 600 million people currently without mains electricity supply. In Rwanda, 9.5 million people or 81% of the population cannot access mains electricity, which has a negative impact on quality of life and limits people’s chances of achieving economic prosperity.</p>\n\n<p>BBOXX is helping to address this issue by providing off-grid communities in developing countries with affordable energy solutions. BBOXX customers typically use a Pay-As-You-Go payment method, which enables very low-income customers access to electricity at home that they would otherwise not be able to afford. To date BBOXX has installed more than 150,000 systems and provided around 750,000 people with access to energy.</p>\n\n<p>Check out our impact here</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.bboxx.co.uk/customers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.bboxx.co.uk/customers/</a> (<a href=\"https://workable.com/nr?l=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bboxx.co.uk%2Fcustomers%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://workable.com/nr?l=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bboxx.co.uk%2Fcustomers%2F</a>)</p>\n\n<p>Title: Test Manager</p>\n\n<p>Reports to: Devices Senior Manager</p>\n\n<p>Location: Chiswick, London</p>\n\n<p>About the role</p>\n\n<p>As the test strategy lead at BBOXX you will work alongside a growing team of multi-disciplinary engineers to produce market-leading products for the off-grid energy sector across the developing world.</p>\n\n<p>Your role will be to promote development excellence through the roll out, reviewing and encouraging of test practices.
