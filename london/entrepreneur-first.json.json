They're funded by leading VCs and angel investors from across Europe, Asia and the US, including Index Ventures, Balderton Capital, and Y Combinator.

We are the world’s leading talent investor - we invest time and money in outstanding individuals, helping them find a co-founder, develop an idea, and start a technology company from scratch.  Across our programmes in Europe and Asia, to date we have helped over 2000 individuals build more than 230 companies, with a total valuation of $1.5 billion. EF’s companies have been funded by many of the leading venture investors in Europe, Asia and Silicon Valley. Our major exits to date include Magic Pony Technology which was acquired by Twitter for a reported $150m only 18 months after the Founders met on the EF programme.\n\nEF now faces the biggest and most exciting challenge in its history: scaling to become a globally important institution. To be accessible and attractive to the world’s most ambitious people, we’re opening our inaugural North American cohort in Toronto, with the first 50 candidates starting in Q2 2020. \nOn top of being operationally exciting, this role offers you the chance to be part of the founding team, creating EF culture abroad, and work on the IP for the company’s most crucial scaling mechanism.\n\nThe Form Manager will own the process of building startups from scratch in our Toronto office - how we turn individuals into teams, and how we develop world changing ideas. This is a high responsibility role with an opportunity for immediate impact, a steep learning curve, as well as long-term incentives and development. \nAt EF, the Form Team enables the world’s most ambitious individuals to build world changing companies. This means identifying a cohort of 100+ individuals and helping turn them into world-class startups. After the Form stage, EF invests and the Launch Team prepares them for external funding. \nIt once seemed impossible to build companies from scratch. Over the past 8 years, we've built a robust, scalable way to do this. Our method creates some of the most valuable startups produced in Europe and Asia. EF has a unique opportunity to develop the secret to building billion dollar companies from scratch. No other organisation has access to this. This is the Form Manager's ‘North Star’.\nRead this to find out why the Form matters.\n \nResponsibilities\nYou will manage the team that runs EF Toronto's Form programme. This is the main company building part of EF and is a 14 week programme that begins from when we offer an individual, through to when we invest in the company they create. This team catalyses the work done by our Talent and Admissions efforts. This is the core of EF’s unique methodology. \nThe total Toronto Team, which you'll be an integral part of, has the following responsibilities: \n Talent and Admissions Support pre-EF’s initial offer. \nAs Form Manager, you won't just be involved in company building, but in finding the best early stage founders too. You will encourage the smartest and highest potential candidates to apply to the programme, then identify the best and brightest applicants from the pool. This is a unique challenge: no other organisation has found a way of assessing individuals’ raw potential to be founders.\nParticipate in our talent outreach through sourcing pipelines and high touch interactions\nSupport the selection and interview process\n Cultivation. Ensure everyone we offer to join EF, joins. \nEvery person we offer that doesn’t join is a missed opportunity to build something massive. Your mission is to ensure offer holders know EF is the highest value use of their time. Joining EF should be as extraordinary an experience as joining Harvard, McKinsey, or Google.\nCreate a world class pre-joining experience for offer holders.\nSpend time with offer holders to ensure they join.\nProblem solve with selected offer holders to prepare them. \n Team building. Crack the code for founding teams. \nAs Form Manager, you'll have responsibility for the quality of companies that are created during EF Form. We have developed a robust team building method.

      "descriptionHtml": "<p>About Entrepreneur First<br>\nEntrepreneur First was founded in 2011 by Alice Bentinck and Matt Clifford with the aim of enabling the world’s most ambitious people to build the most important companies, and that is still true today. We are the world’s leading talent investor - we invest time and money in outstanding individuals, helping them find a co-founder, develop an idea, and start a technology company from scratch.  Across our programmes in Europe and Asia, to date we have helped over 2000 individuals build more than 230 companies, with a total valuation of $1.5 billion. EF’s companies have been funded by many of the leading venture investors in Europe, Asia and Silicon Valley. Our major exits to date include Magic Pony Technology which was acquired by Twitter for a reported $150m only 18 months after the Founders met on the EF programme.</p>\n\n<p>EF now faces the biggest and most exciting challenge in its history: scaling to become a globally important institution. To be accessible and attractive to the world’s most ambitious people, we’re opening our inaugural North American cohort in Toronto, with the first 50 candidates starting in Q2 2020. <br>\nOn top of being operationally exciting, this role offers you the chance to be part of the founding team, creating EF culture abroad, and work on the IP for the company’s most crucial scaling mechanism.</p>\n\n<p>The Form Manager will own the process of building startups from scratch in our Toronto office - how we turn individuals into teams, and how we develop world changing ideas. This is a high responsibility role with an opportunity for immediate impact, a steep learning curve, as well as long-term incentives and development. <br>\nAt EF, the Form Team enables the world’s most ambitious individuals to build world changing companies. This means identifying a cohort of 100+ individuals and helping turn them into world-class startups. After the Form stage, EF invests and the Launch Team prepares them for external funding. <br>\nIt once seemed impossible to build companies from scratch. Over the past 8 years, we&#39;ve built a robust, scalable way to do this. Our method creates some of the most valuable startups produced in Europe and Asia. EF has a unique opportunity to develop the secret to building billion dollar companies from scratch. No other organisation has access to this. This is the Form Manager&#39;s ‘North Star’.<br>\nRead this to find out why the Form matters.</p>\n\n<p>Responsibilities<br>\nYou will manage the team that runs EF Toronto&#39;s Form programme. This is the main company building part of EF and is a 14 week programme that begins from when we offer an individual, through to when we invest in the company they create. This team catalyses the work done by our Talent and Admissions efforts. This is the core of EF’s unique methodology. <br>\nThe total Toronto Team, which you&#39;ll be an integral part of, has the following responsibilities: <br>\n Talent and Admissions Support pre-EF’s initial offer. <br>\nAs Form Manager, you won&#39;t just be involved in company building, but in finding the best early stage founders too. You will encourage the smartest and highest potential candidates to apply to the programme, then identify the best and brightest applicants from the pool. This is a unique challenge: no other organisation has found a way of assessing individuals’ raw potential to be founders.<br>\nParticipate in our talent outreach through sourcing pipelines and high touch interactions<br>\nSupport the selection and interview process<br>\n Cultivation. Ensure everyone we offer to join EF, joins. <br>\nEvery person we offer that doesn’t join is a missed opportunity to build something massive. Your mission is to ensure offer holders know EF is the highest value use of their time. Joining EF should be as extraordinary an experience as joining Harvard, McKinsey, or Google.<br>\nCreate a world class pre-joining experience for offer holders.<br>\nSpend time with offer holders to ensure they join.<br>\nProblem solve with selected offer holders to prepare them. <br>\n Team building. Crack the code for founding teams. <br>\nAs Form Manager, you&#39;ll have responsibility for the quality of companies that are created during EF Form. We have developed a robust team building method. But, there is still much to learn. Your mission is to build as many strong teams as possible.<br>\nWork with sole founders to help them progress into teams.<br>\nActively manage team breakups and formation.<br>\nDevelop EF&#39;s team building frameworks.<br>\nUse EF&#39;s data to create optimal co-founding teams. <br>\n Ideation. Ensure the teams work on high potential ideas <br>\nWe influence what ideas EF founders work on enormously. Your mission is to make these ideas as high potential as possible.<br>\nWork with EF founders to develop their ideas.<br>\nDevelop EF&#39;s frameworks on ideation.</p>\n\n<p>Requirements<br>\nYou should excel with process and people, be strategic but enjoy getting your hands dirty and want a fast paced role. You should have a high EQ and be able to move between moments of high intensity decision making as well as emotive and difficult interpersonal situations.</p>\n\n<p>Experience: You should:<br>\nBe a strong execution-oriented problem solver. <br>\nHave been a founder or worked in an early-stage startup.<br>\nWorked at a top tier company.<br>\nWorked in or with startups at a senior level.<br>\nPersonal: You will:<br>\nBe an expert problem solver who thinks on their feet<br>\nHave high EQ and enjoy working with people<br>\nBe an engaged upside thinker<br>\nBe extremely ambitious<br>\nHave a strong growth mindset<br>\nHave outstanding organisational skills<br>\nBe a strong communicator<br>\nBe very comfortable with managing competing priorities<br>\nTraining and development<br>\nYour experience will be invaluable, but nowhere are startups built the way they are built at EF.

We are the world’s leading talent investor - we invest time and money in outstanding individuals, helping them find a co-founder, develop an idea, and start a technology company from scratch.\nAcross our programmes in Europe and Asia, to date we have helped over 2000 individuals build more than 230 companies, with a total valuation of $1.5 billion. EF’s companies have been funded by many of the leading venture investors in Europe, Asia and Silicon Valley. Our major exits to date include Magic Pony Technology which was acquired by Twitter for a reported $150m only 18 months after the Founders met on the EF programme.\n\n\nThe Role\nThe Talent Manager is an exciting role that will own and develop a huge part of our business in Berlin. It’s a massive role, which offers an enormous opportunity for immediate impact on our business, a large amount of responsibility, and a steep and continued learning curve. This isn’t a conventional talent acquisition role - you’ll be recruiting the potential founders of some of the world’s most important tech companies.\n\nWe are looking for a smart and motivated team member with some experience in talent acquisition or sales, ideally with a track record of building and managing high-performance recruiting teams and creative implementation of talent strategy. The Talent Manger will be solely responsible for leading the team who ensure the best talent from across the globe is found, attracted and applies to EF.

You dig deep to make improvements at every stage.\n- Managing and measuring work - you can set stretching performance goals with clear measurables\n- Upward management/reporting - you create tight feedback loops and can present clear headlines to important stakeholders. You know when the detail is needed.\n- Problem-solving and planning - you instinctively anticipate and adjust for problems and roadblocks. You solve them with logic.\n- Influencing and closing - you know how to set specific goals which lead towards desired outcomes and have a good sense of timing\n- Fluency in German would be advantageous, but not essential\n\nExperience\n- Building and managing high-performance teams - you’ve had experience setting stretch goals for direct reports and have proven experience delivering results. You’re great at giving continuous feedback and getting the best out of your team and share wins.\n- Pipeline-driven workflows - you’re familiar working with high-volume pipelines, leads, pass rates, and engagement metrics. You’re familiar making short-term and long-term ROI decisions.\n- Sales or Talent experience - you have been a manager in either a sales or recruitment team in a high-growth organisation.\n- Tech talent insights - you have an understanding of the tech talent landscape and know who the big players are.\n- Startup knowledge - you’ve worked with or for startups and have a good view of the local ecosystem.
