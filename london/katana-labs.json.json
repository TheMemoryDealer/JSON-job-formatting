      "description": "Katana is an ING innovation project that is spinning out of the bank with backing from ING Ventures and other investors. The tool uses advanced analytics powered by machine learning to help investment teams discover relative value opportunities in the bond market. It has been used by a large asset manager since the first prototype release in April 2018 and by a growing number of other asset managers in the last few months. Katana has attracted considerable media attention and won prestigious awards for innovation in capital markets, including the “top Corporate Finance innovator 2019” by the Global Finance magazine. \nKatana is designed to help asset managers make better decisions. Portfolio managers find opportunities faster and execute profitable ideas that they would otherwise miss. Our purpose is to enhance the investment process with data driven insights and a superior user experience. There is no competing product in the market and our plan is to evolve into a relative value trading platform for bonds. \nWe are a dynamic early-stage start-up supported by large institutions as investors and clients. Our ambition over the next 24 months is to capitalise on our first mover advantage, develop the functionality to capture execution flow and scale up the business. \nThe team comprises of a UX designer, developers, data scientists and subject matter experts. We believe in putting together our strengths for developing a great product. The customer is at the centre of our product development and we incorporate design thinking, cloud technologies and AI algorithms. We strive to be lean, agile and learn continuously. We claim ownership as a team on every feature we define, develop and implement. We celebrate outcomes and not outputs.\nIf you would like to work in a London-based fintech at the core of the digital revolution in capital markets, in a small diverse team with big ambitions and can’t wait to see your creations become a product that users love, please read on!  \n\n*Your passion* \nAs an experienced developer you are excited by the prospect of building and maintaining the foundation on which our application is built. You are comfortable with using multiple languages as you believe in using the right tool for the right job. Leveraging them to build a resilient, high performing platform. Cloud native technologies and their strengths and challenges are known to you.\n\nAs a strong believer in DevOps practices, you work with our data scientists, UX’ers, frontend developers and the rest of our multidisciplinary team, to deliver complete features and improvements. You take ownership and pride in your work : from the first line of code, to automated tests and monitoring in production. You take a scientific approach to your work, only being content when it has been proven to add value to our customers.\n\nAs a true full stack developer, you like working on features front to back, on occasion making the frontend changes you need to complete your work. \nYou take a proactive stance towards our system.
