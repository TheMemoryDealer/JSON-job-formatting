We also help reduce the biased 'echo chambers' created by social media.  In this way we are truly a 'tech-for-good' company.\n\nSince our community of users and respondents is diverse we aim for the same in our team.  We have a healthy attitude towards flexible hours, remote working and part-time / job-share where possible.  Whilst subject matter expertise is desirable, we welcome applicants from all walks of life.\n\nCurrent state of play:\nOver the last 3 years we have seen continued 100% year-on-year growth in revenue.  As we close a Series A funding round, we are committed to a further 100% year-on-year growth, seeing revenues rise from £2-4m from July20 - June21.\n\nWho we are looking for:\nWe are looking for a strong Business Development Manager, someone with comprehensive experience of professional B2B sales and a great track record of closing deals.  Passionate and committed, you will be able to convincingly articulate our vision and the value we bring to our customers.\n\nIn return you will earn a competitive salary and generous OTE package as well as the opportunity to become a shareholder in an ambitious, financially secure start-up.\n\nSkills:\nClosing sales, building pipeline, delivering revenue and delighting customers\nLead generation; managing the qualification and sales process of each prospect\nDeveloping and executing winning sales plans\nBuilding and developing relationships\nIdentifying decision-makers and understanding the decision-making process\n\nKnowledge:\nExperience of using a CRM system, and other digital tools such as Slack and Google Docs\nA working knowledge of how marketing campaigns and LinkedIn can create sales leads\nAny knowledge of the ‘built environment’ - public sector procurement process, private developers, house builders etc - beneficial but not essential\n\nBehaviours:\nA passion for cross-functional collaboration.\nA can-do, self-starter attitude.\nEnergy and an appetite to work at pace.\nComfort with the ambiguity and change of a start-up.\nAbility to get up to speed quickly on new products, services, markets and relationships.\n\nAbout us:\nOur product delivers extraordinary engagement from communities and insights to our customers.

This role is about developing new and existing relationships in the [sector / region] to win more priority customers and extend business with existing customers.  \n\nMore about us:\nWe are a group of technologists, designers and urbanists with a strong belief in open collaboration and the benefits it brings to communities.
