  "description": "We're a Rental Marketplace where Agent/s Landlords post their properties and Tenants search for them. We look to do two things:\n\n1) Speed up Search - Using Machine Learning to recommend and learn what properties are appropriate for which Tenants. Currently, property search is completely non-dynamic leading to a very long search period (40 hours on average)\n\n2) End-to-end onboarding - you can do all your searching, offers, references and contracts all within the PerchPeek platform meaning there are no more dodgy deposits, crazy contract clauses or ropey references. \n\nCheck out the website now.",
