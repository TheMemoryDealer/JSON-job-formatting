  "slogan": "Interbank intraday lending trading platform",
  "description": "Finteum has created a trading platform for banks to borrow and lend to one another for hours at a time. Intraday liquidity is very expensive for banks, who are our potential clients, and intraday borrowing and lending is very valuable. We started in 2018 with expertise in this field and have built the 'alpha' version of the product. We are excited to build it out further, together with early adopter banks. We are partnering with R3 (a blockchain company with bank backing), Baringa Partners (a consulting company with expertise in intraday liquidity and bank clients) and collaborating with Fnality (central bank money on blockchain company with bank backing). We graduated from the F10 Fintech accelerator in Zurich. We are looking for great back-end software engineers.",
