  "description": "Hello! We’re Ember, the world’s first software platform to automate the accounting process for SMEs.\n\nLeveraging Open Banking, Machine Learning & Making Tax Digital, Ember is the first solution to automate the business administration process from bank transaction right through to tax submission without ever leaving the platform, rendering expensive accounting software and manual bookkeeping services redundant.\n\nEmber is initially targeting the 5.4 million owner managed micro-businesses in the UK, who spend an estimated £4.5 billion p/a on banking services and accounting software. Ember’s ambition is to eliminate the administrative burden for 50 million businesses worldwide by 2030 using artificial intelligence.\n\nDue to launch in July to a closed group of 20 SME’s and publicly in September, Ember aims to be one of the biggest Fintech entrants to the market in recent years.",
