  "description": "A digital wellbeing platform for SME through to Enterprise customers. Wellbe is an engaging workplace Wellbeing tool, that helps to prevent health conditions, and that educates about and encourages self-care.\n\nWe are passionate about Wellbeing and believe that everyone should prioritise their Wellbeing, which will help them live an optimal life.\n\nAs a team we have all experienced anxiety, stress, or depression at some point during our lives and have not found an accessible solution that helps us deal with all of these issues, inside the workplace or outside of it.\n\nWe want to make self-care accessible to everyone. We know that everyone has different Wellbeing needs and so we want to build a platform that solves problems for everyone individually, not as a whole. \n\nCompanies are waking up to the fact that they have a corporate responsibility for their employees’ mental health and wellbeing, and they must take preventative action in supporting their people. \n\n\n\n",
