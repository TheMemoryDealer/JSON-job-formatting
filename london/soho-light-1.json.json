  "description": "yellowpop was created from our fear of white walls and sad spaces.\n\nWe wanted to find a simple way to fill an empty room with joy and warmth.\n \nOur inspiration came from where people are happiest – outside, soaking up the sunshine. So we found a way to replicate the glow and energy that comes from a day spent in the sun (minus the vitamin D), and that’s when yellowpop was born.\n \nWhether it’s day or night, whether you’re at home, the office or an event, you can flip on one of our neons and watch the space around it glow. And if you look around, you’ll see the faces of those who look at the neon glow as well – both literally and figuratively.\n \nNeons have a way of bringing immediate joy to everyone around them, thanks to their warm glow and upbeat vibes.\n \nSeeing that glow is what keeps us excited to grow and innovate on our product offerings.\n ",
