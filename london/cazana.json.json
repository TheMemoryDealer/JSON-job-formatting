  "description": "Cazana provides automotive insights for the future of vehicle ownership. Using big data and predictive analytics, Cazana analyses millions of automotive transactions daily to assess the value and risk associated with every vehicle on the road.\n\nCazana's systems are used by manufacturers, finance companies, dealerships and insurers globally. Companies use Cazana’s data to provide vehicles to the modern automotive consumer who is in search of mobility, not ownership.\n\nOur small team is growing fast, in-part thanks to our rapid revenue growth and supported by our recent investment by leading VCs Passion Capital and Payman Pouladdej. We’re very keen to create a high-performing culture whilst having fun. We’re fixing some extremely interesting problems that have the potential to completely disrupt the multi-billion pound used car industry and we’re looking for people that are passionate about working to solve interesting problems with the latest technology and agile working practices. \n",
