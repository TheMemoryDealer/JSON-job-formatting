  "description": "Whilst cocktails are booming, the ability to deliver high quality drinks at volume represents a challenge within the events world, on-trade, and for consumers looking for a simpler and faster way to mix drinks at home. This can result in quality variance from drink to drink. \n\nThe Rum Runner has a way to solve this: to minimize the margin for error, remove the cost and hassle of training, whilst not compromising on quality, we put together the fresh elements of our cocktails in our unit, meaning that a bartender only has to remember that the perfect cocktail simply requires 50ml of alcohol, and 50ml of cocktail mixer. When the bar gets busier, the quality doesn't slip. Simple. \n\nWe are also working on a proposition to create a premium cocktail mixer with shelf life in order to service both the On and Off-Trade.",
