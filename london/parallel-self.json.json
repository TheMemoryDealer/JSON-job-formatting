      "description": "Dear interested person. Firstly, thank you for taking the time to read this.\n\nI am involve in a project called Parallel Self. The idea is to help people help themselves – help make good decisions and help them ultimately be the best they can be. The project is very much driven by the desire to create social well being in individuals as much as it is to create a self-sustaining initiative creating strong financial returns.\n\nVarious concepts and frameworks have been developed as well as some visual mock-ups of the concept too. There is also a growing group of highly talented and successful supporters and advisers.\n\nWe now need to find someone to help us build out these mock-ups and frameworks into a 1st version demo / prototype - MVP - to have something tangible to work with and share with those who will provide seed funding. We are looking for someone to do the coding for us and build this MVP prototype quickly and very cost-effectively.\n\nSome funds & / or some equity could be available for the right person or persons.\n\nThank you very much in advance for your interest. We look forwards to hearing from you.\n\nAll the best",
