  "description": "Limio is an investor-backed, UK-based startup that is changing the way companies manage business-to-consumer (B2C) subscriptions. The subscription economy is growing fast: 58 millions British people now subscribe to services, be it Spotify, Amazon Prime, HelloFresh, ZipCar or the Economist (a paying customer). Our no-code Subscription Commerce Polution enables these companies to quickly launch and scale personalised  acquisition and retention experiences to their subscribers without any development. Our goal is to be the next Shopify for subscriptions.\n\nLimio was founded by Amaury de Closset and Daniel Morton, formerly of GoCardless (YC S11), Zuora, BCG and Three. Together, they have a track record of 15 years in subscriptions. ",
