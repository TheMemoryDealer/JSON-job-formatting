  "description": "We are a firm dedicated to empower startups and more established companies to untap the potential of artificial intelligence solutions in their business. In the life span of a company it may occur that the team lack of the complete skillset to solve complex problems and the normally extended time to overcome the difficulties can hinder the success of the company itself. In these scenarios, AI technologies offers an immediate impact solution within a short timeframe from the first consultation.\nCouple of clients we worked on:\n\neezylife.com: An app to recommend evening venues (restaurants, bars..) based on the personality of the users rather than the 'best rating' as it in the most used platform at the moment (tripadvisor, opentable etc.) We developed the matching system between the user and the venues.\nbreakr: An app that allows users to exchange voice messages with minimum interaction with the phone. We designed and implemented the voice detection.",
