Our ambition is to push the boundaries of the type of user experiences and developer workflows made possible by blending web and native technologies.\n\nAs a Mobile App Engineer at Peakon, you will be bringing native app expertise to a team developing new mobile products, primarily for line managers using Peakon daily to improve their team’s happiness, productivity and engagement. You will work closely with our experienced JavaScript and React developers to build world class mobile experiences for our customers.\n\n\nRequirements\n\nOur ideal candidate has…\n\n* +2 years experience working as a mobile app engineer in an agile team\n* Experience in developing, shipping and maintaining a native app for the Android platform\n* Some experience with web technologies like JavaScript\n* Some knowledge of React Native and its capabilities, or experience working with other cross-platform frameworks for native app development\n* Some experience or interest in working with modern JavaScript technologies\n* Detail-oriented, focusing on writing maintainable code of high quality\n* Experience in using automated testing\n\nWe welcome your application even if you do not meet all of the criteria listed above, but are excited about the challenge of mastering this role.

We are primarily hosted on Heroku and AWS, with an increasing number of our services moving to the latter. We use PostgreSQL (through RDS), Redis and ElasticSearch for storage.\n\nWe rely heavily on automated testing on all levels of the application, with thousands of tests checking every commit to our code base.

We are highly motivated by learning and growing in our roles, and constantly evolving is a key part of that.</p>\n\n<p>The tech stack of Peakon centers around Javascript, with Node.js on the server and React on the frontend. We believe there is great value in a shared toolchain across the stack, enabling engineers to work on all parts of the system. Some tasks are better solved with different tools, and thus we use f.ex. Python for the data science parts of the system.</p>\n\n<p>We are big fans of new JavaScript language features like async/await, and have made it a priority to stay up to date with the latest versions of Node. We are primarily hosted on Heroku and AWS, with an increasing number of our services moving to the latter. We use PostgreSQL (through RDS), Redis and ElasticSearch for storage.</p>\n\n<p>We rely heavily on automated testing on all levels of the application, with thousands of tests checking every commit to our code base. We use CircleCI for hosted continuous integration to make sure our most recent changes are always available to test, and we deploy code to our production environment on a daily basis.</p>\n\n<p>Benefits</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Unlimited holiday</li>\n<li>Subsidised lunch everyday</li>\n<li>Flexible working</li>\n<li>Company wide trips</li>\n<li>Choice of hardware</li>\n<li>Flexible travel policy</li>\n<li>Pension</li>\n</ul>\n",
