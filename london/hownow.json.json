      "descriptionHtml": "<p>HowNow is one of the top 50 technology startups in the UK, disrupting the way the world learns. Backed by Mark Pearson (Founder of MyVoucherCodes) and Tennis Superstar Andy Murray, HowNow is using smart technology to better humans, rather than replace them.</p>\n\n<p>HowNow is a cloud-based knowledge sharing platform that helps capture and curate knowledge from experts and peers, and deliver it at the point of need in the digital workplace. With the average shelf life of skills being a mere 5 years, it is paramount that organisations continuously invest in upskilling and training their employees. Formal learning systems i.e. offsite seminars, retreats, LMSes, are not up to the task because they are expensive, not engaging, unidirectional and not designed for the digital workplace. We are disrupting this $9bn market with a new product category that brings together content curation, contextual delivery and social knowledge sharing.</p>\n\n<p>The HowNow HQ is based in London and we are in the process of building a new team for our recently opened Mumbai office.
