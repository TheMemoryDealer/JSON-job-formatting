  "description": "fieldmargin is a mobile-first, design-led and cloud-based mapping and note recording system, specifically developed in response to industry-wide frustrations with the antiquated and expensive solutions already on offer.\n\nIn the UK, 71% of land is farmland, farming employs almost 500,000 people and yet most software for farmers is delivered on compact disc and data is held locally on desktop machines. Globally, 1.4bn people are directly employed in the agriculture industry.\n\nWe will allow farmers to integrate their drone photography, satellite imagery, historical paper maps, IoT sensors and machinery, to fully understand what’s happening on their farms.\n\nIn the next 40 years the world will have to produce more food than it has done in the previous 8000. We are doing something in an enormous industry, we are doing something hard, and if we get it right the world will benefit.",
