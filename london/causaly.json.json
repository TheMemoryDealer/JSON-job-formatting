  "description": "We are developing the world’s biggest data platform for Cause and Effect evidence in Biomedicine using AI Machine-Reading technology. \n\nSee here why we love what we do:\nhttps://www.causaly.com/blog/advancing-clinical-with-ai-hemorrhagic-disease-of-newborn-5d3c445719515e0017f558bb\n\nThe technology is self-developed and proprietary, powering a massive Biomedical Causal Knowledge Graph. It helps researchers and decision-makers to discover insights from 30,000,000 academic publications, in minutes. Causaly is used by Pharmaceutical companies and Academia in Research and Commercial departments, for Drug Discovery and Drug Safety.\n",
