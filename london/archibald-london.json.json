      "description": "What is Archibald?\n\n\nPut very simply, Archibald is an idea that there is a better way that will allow more people to access better items. It is a bold and unique vision that challenges every preconceived notion of luxury retail and looks to break it.\n\n\nArchibald searches for and works with the world's most talented craftsmen in order to make the finest, most beautifully crafted products available directly to discerning consumers without the excessive mark-ups of conventional luxury brands and retailers- whether that’s copper pans, cashmere sweaters, Italian leather sneakers or Japanese eyewear. There are no limits to our vision, with plans in Q1 2020 to move into the artisanal food space as well. \n\n\nhttps://www.archibaldlondon.com/motivation\n\n\nWe have a unique way of working and believe every day to be the worst it can get. Therefore, you will have the opportunity to work within a group of risk-takers willing to take chances and challenge established processes and norms. This is not a role for someone who wants to simply apply an algorithmic approach and quote industry best practices. This is a role for a true thinker, someone willing to enter into passionate and heated discussions to find the answer.\n\n\nThe successful candidate will be responsible for all on-site written content, developing a compelling brand voice and working with our in-house design and visual teams to ideate and produce engaging advertising campaigns.\n\n\nBeyond this, the ideal candidate will need to be fearless and willing to experiment creatively with out-of-the-ordinary copy. The kind that has thumb-stopping potential on a social media feed or might be frowned upon within most brands. The post-holder will need to be comfortable in a fast-paced environment where ideas are tried and tested in real-time, and new projects gather momentum at breakneck speed. \n\n\nKey responsibilities will include:\n\n\n-Taking ownership of brand voice, style and tone so that Archibald is instantly recognizable to its core following and beyond.\n-Ideating and executing bold advertising campaigns with in-house and external creatives and marketing teams.\n-Producing and managing all Archibald content across multiple channels at pace.\n-Partnering with Marketing and Design teams to ensure content is fully SEO optimised in line with Archibald’s digital strategy to generate leads and increase traffic.\n-Working with colleagues to produce engaging content for web pages, promotional material, the blog space and more.\n-Liaise closely with Archibald’s New York-based PR representative to come up with relevant media hooks for emerging work and newly launched products and control all outward brand communications.\n-Engage with Archibald’s existing online communities on Facebook, Styleforum and more. Open and foster relationships with other communities both online and offline.\n-Produce ad-hoc content that is tailored to the company’s audience that meets marketing objectives\n-Ad-hoc projects as requested\n\nWe are looking for someone who:\n\n-Is creative and unafraid to do something different or unconventional.\n-Has gravitas, credibility and strong communication skills\n-Has an excellent turn of phrase and doesn’t shy away from trying bold new approaches.
