  "description": "Diadem provides a billing, payment, and subscriber contracting system for Mobile Network Operators (MNO) using de-centralised smart contracts on a blockchain platform. Abstracting the contract and billing mechanism from the operator’s traditional business support systems and moving it to a blockchain platform provides huge benefits for MNOs such as contract flexibility and transparency, additional security, cost reduction, and scalability.",
