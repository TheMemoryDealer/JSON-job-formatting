The NHS are our client and the patient experience is at the heart of what we do. You will have an appreciation for a longer and certainly more complex sales process yet be a techy at heart and can quickly get to grips with our product inside and out.\n\nResponsibilities include:\n\n- You will be the engine of DrDoctor – ensuring that the business can continue to grow through delivering exceptional partnerships with our clients.\n- You will be measured on your Sales performance and will be responsible for prospects across multiple stages of the sales process. \n- Pitch DrDoctor to multiple layers of seniority within the NHS and know how to add value in conversation, whatever the scenario. \n- As the face of DrDoctor, you will keep the business up to date with how contracts are progressing and meet monthly and annual KPI’s.\n- Coach and champion the SDR team to help them with appointment setting.\n- Liaise with all parts of the DrDoctor team to ensure effective implementation of our services for our customers.\n\n**OK, That’s me, but who are you?**\n\nDrDoctor is a fast-growing digital health company founded in 2012.

I've held a few different roles in that time, and most recently have been enjoying the world of sales. I'm excited by DrDoctor's current traction in the market and our pipeline is sure to keep us busy. Aside from that, we work in an amazing team - hard-working, clever and the friendliest bunch! To be a success at DrDoctor you need to be a team player and being self-motivated will really help.\n\n**OK, I’m interested. What experience do I need to have?**\n\n- You know how to adapt your style to varying levels of people within the NHS.\n- Would be useful to have an existing network of decision makers within secondary care.\n- You are a consultative seller, you are already working with longer and complex sales cycles.\n- Have the ability to simplify a complex set of problems and structure the right solution for our clients - this may include project planning, technical understanding etc. \n- You excel in a high growth environment, and love getting the work done right.\n- Can work across multiple levels of an organisation, and you understand that the receptionist is as important as the CEO.\n- Motivated to take the early train to meet a prospect, because you know how much face time matters.\n- You are passionate about our mission.\n- Ideally you have a working knowledge of the NHS.\n- You are able to demonstrate you have meet or exceeded your current and previous sales targets.\n\n**We are perfect for each other, what are the next steps?**\n\nWe are currently recruiting heavily and have a lot of CV’s to go through.
