  "description": "NearSt's technology helps you search for a product and see which stores have it in stock nearby, directly in places like Google.\n\nOur retail technology platform - NearLIVE - makes this possible by connecting the products stocked in high street shops directly into the places on the web where customers are searching. We do this using real-time local inventory technology - our unique single view of exactly who stocks what, where, and when. By connecting our real-time local inventory data to the sites, apps and services already used by shoppers we’re truly making buying local faster and easier than buying online.\n",
