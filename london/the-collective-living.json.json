We ensure the places we deliver are extraordinary, breaking the mould, creative and innovative spaces that challenge every concept.  We own the process of creating buildings that enhance every aspect of our member’s lives through community, convenience, and value.  \nWe want free thinkers, exhilarated individuals that always want to make the next best thing, strive for perfection and challenge every perception. We're looking for highly motivated, switched-on and down to earth individuals that are willing to roll up their sleeves and do whatever it takes to be the best in their field, challenge the status quo and deliver high quality results.\nThe Collective are at a pivotal point of growth. In the last 18 months we’ve transitioned into a global business, with offices and upcoming projects in the US and Germany, providing a total of over 7000 co- living units under development. In order to fund this growth we’ve raised over $700 million in capital, and our gross assets are now valued in excess of $2 billion.\nThe Collective is dedicated to promoting diversity, multiculturalism and equality in all that we do. Inclusion is more than a buzzword to us — it's the foundation of our business. Our communities are focused on increased access and personal growth, and their greatness depends on a diversity of race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, ethnicity, national origin and perspective. We're an equal opportunity employer and we're excited to build the future of co-living with the world's most talented and passionate people.\n\nAbout The Role\n\nThis is a unique opportunity to be part of The Collective’s emerging Data Science team.

You’re at ease explaining your thinking to others, discussing different approaches to problems and working collaboratively with people from other disciplines including data analysts, data scientists, engineers, product managers, marketers and executive teams to creatively identify new solutions.\nStrong technical skills and proficiency at performing data analysis in any kind of programmatic analysis tool are a must, and it would be beneficial to also have familiarity with SQL; you’ll also have a keen attitude to learning new data science skills and tools that ensure we leverage the most appropriate programs, languages and techniques as the space develops.\nYou understand the value of good documentation, security best practices, and process, all of which are important for this role and inform everything we do.\nA quantitative background (for example Bsc or Msc in Maths, Physics, Engineering, Economics) is a must to be able to succeed in this pivotal role within the business; we’re also open to applications directly from university who have completed at least one internship as well as candidates with 1 to 3 years’ experience.",
