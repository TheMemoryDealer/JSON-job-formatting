And we intend to do so while keeping the emphasis on the “Engineering” part. This is an exceptional opportunity for you to come onboard and shape the future of this system.\n\n\nScaling this resiliently across the millions of transactions happening globally requires a sophisticated microservice architecture and a more than the usual big data lip service.

On a mission to help you live inspired.</p>\n\n<p>About You</p>\n\n<p>At Curve, we believe that an SRE is a person attracted by a blurring lines between development and operations with strong fundamentals in both worlds. Not scared by the complexity of code or by the configuration nuances of an operating system.<br>\nWe’re a small team but growing quickly! And we intend to do so while keeping the emphasis on the “Engineering” part. This is an exceptional opportunity for you to come onboard and shape the future of this system.</p>\n\n<p>Scaling this resiliently across the millions of transactions happening globally requires a sophisticated microservice architecture and a more than the usual big data lip service.
