  "description": "In the stock market, trading is done electronically by robots, news is instant, data is abundant. In the world of high yield bonds, trading is done by humans over the phone, news takes 20 minutes to hit the market and data sucks. The debt capital markets behave like it's still the 1980s. 9fin aims to fix that.\n\n9fin is artificial intelligence powered financial data for the bond market. We use computer vision & machine learning to find key data on bonds and the companies who issue them. Then we make the data easy to search, filter & analyse at 9fin.com. \n\nUsed by world leading banks, hedge funds and asset managers. Backed by leading VC funds & the only fintech in Europe accepted onto Google's AI residency program. Selected for IA Velocity program, first ever accelerator run by the Investment Association whose members manage £7.7 trillion AUM.",
