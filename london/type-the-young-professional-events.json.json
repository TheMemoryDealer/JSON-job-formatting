  "description": "What is the product \nWe offer three main event streams, Network, Recharge, Inspire. Each stream is designed to fit seamlessly into the young professional lifestyle. Our team collates quantitative and qualitative feedback to design, deliver and evaluate each event in order to create educated and tailored events.\n\nOur target demographic is not age-specific, but mind-specific. We do not target our members by age, industry or gender but we look for members and event attendees to join our community who realise that their network can be more than just their normal circle and their social media connections. TYPE is the key to unlock their network.",
