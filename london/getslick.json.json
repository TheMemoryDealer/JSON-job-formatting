  "description": "In the absence of the right digital product offering, hair & beauty salons are forced to spend too much time on admin leaving less time for doing what they love. The Slick smart, omnichannel booking platform exactly mimics manual appointment entry from multiple sources, meaning salons can now be confident about the benefits of online booking and automated client data collection. Salons possess a wealth of information on stylist behaviour, consumer trends, and industry market share, but due to low digital penetration, this data remains woefully underexploited. Collection, analysis, and monetisation of data through AI applications represents an even bigger opportunity for Slick and is a core part of our roadmap.\n",
