That’s why we are building a solution from scratch, specifically for cars.

Your code is simple and you don’t like to over-engineer solutions. You care about making the product easier to use for people not about shipping more lines of code or features. We value outcome vs output. \n\nMinimum qualifications:\n- BS degree in Computer Science or similar technical field and min 5 years work experience.\n- Strong experience developing consumer-facing high-performance Android applications\n- Shipping at least 5 apps to the app store that you’ve built and maintained. \n- Experience with Kotlin and RxJava\n- Advanced knowledge of Java.\n- Knowledge of material design patterns\n- Experience developing accessible technologies(low bandwidth lite apps etc).\n- Interest and ability to learn other coding languages as needed.\n\nBonus points:\n- If you’ve been in a fast-growing startup before.\n- Master’s, Ph.D. degree, further education in engineering, computer science or related field.\n\nWhat’s in it for you? \nEquity in the startup \nOpportunity, good timing, and resources to build a rocketship startup. \nAccess to world-class advisors: ex-Google, Uber etc\n\nPrinciples \n- Courage \n- Extreme focus \n- Aggressive growth\n\nInterview process:\n1.
