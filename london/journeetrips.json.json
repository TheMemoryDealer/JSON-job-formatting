To take you on a journey of personal growth. To make you happier and more at peace with yourself. We believe the true joy of travel often comes from moments of spontaneity. Especially when it leads to the discovery of a hidden gem or an exciting experience that's treasured forever. Done right, a trip to an interesting and unique destination will break down prejudices and broaden horizons. Travel makes the world a more understanding and\naccepting place.\n\n**However, travel is broken.**\n\nLike you, many times in the past we’ve set out to explore the world, seeking new experiences to free our mind from the stress and routine of normal life. And like you, we’ve fallen into the usual travel traps. Package tours that didn’t reflect our true travel style or bespoke agencies that were heavy on the pocket. Going it alone isn't much better. The stress of sifting through a mountain of online information and the painful task of booking everything.\n\n**There's a better way.**\n\nWe believe there’s a better way of experiencing the magic of travel. A way to discover interesting and unique destinations. A way to explore and absorb the beauty of cultures different from ours.\n\nOur travel experts will carefully match you with an interesting destination based on your travel profile. We'll then plan and book an exciting, experiential trip. The trip will remain a mystery until the last moment. You just need to turn up to the airport ready to explore.\n\n**With Journee, we’re doing travel the way it should be - easy, exciting and experiential.**\n\n**How does Journee work?**\n\nOur Explorers fill in our 15-minute Trip Matchmaker form to build their travel personality. It includes budget, dates, where they don't want to go, and most importantly, the things they like to do when you\ntravel. \n\nWe then match them with a unique and interesting destination and an experiential trip to explore it with. We book and organise everything whilst sending fun clues to keep them guessing.\n\nThey then turn up to the airport X days later and reveal where they’re going!\n\n**What is this position?**\n\nAs Journee’s first full-time marketing hire, you will play a key role in our growth plans. You will be responsible for creating our brand voice and developing and executing a content marketing plan across multiple channels, including performance marketing.\n\nAs one of the first hires at an early-stage team, you will be involved in long-term strategy as well as highly tactical day-to-day execution. Reporting directly to one of the co-founders, this is a rare opportunity to help an early-stage, mission-driven company grow.\n\n**Responsibilities include:**\n\n* Develop a content marketing plan and goals, and execute against both\n* Develop performance marketing campaigns (IG/FB, Google, experiment with others) to deliver successful and sustainable growth\n* Work with freelancers to develop content that delights online travel communities\n* Optimise and experiment with our website to increase conversion\n* Own and experiment with email communications with potential Explorers in our funnel\n* Grow our brand following through content creation, email marketing and social engagement\n* Perform market research and speak to our Explorers to understand messaging effectiveness to evolve our brand, marketing touchpoints and improve overall conversion\n\n**Winning-factors. Must have qualifications:**\n\n* 2+ years of growth/marketing experience at a fast-growing consumer-facing company\n* Experience working across a wide variety of marketing channels including performance and content within a startup environment with limited resources\n* Articulate storyteller - must be able to both speak and write with passion and clarity\n* Analytically minded - must be able to understand and leverage data to drive impactful growth\n* Deadline-driven - you can move fast to produce impactful work\n* Able to break down complex concepts and explain them simply\n* Excited about taking ownership and rolling up your sleeves to get things done\n* An obsessively organised self-starter\n* A passionate traveller\n\n**Benefits:**\n\n* Be a key and early part of an exciting growth story to build a travel brand as big as Airbnb\n* Generous equity percentage - we want you to feel like a founder\n* Mingle with a thriving community of startups at our co-working space, Mainyard Studios\n* Flexible working hours - not everyone is a morning person\n* Free tea, coffee, and snacks every day and lunches on Wednesdays\n* Regular events and talks as a part of Mainyard Studios",
