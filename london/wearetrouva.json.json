There are thousands of small independent boutiques with beautiful product selections spread out across the physical world, but discovering and purchasing these products can be notoriously difficult for consumers. \n\nAt Trouva we provide these independent boutiques with the technology required to thrive online, as well as connecting them with a community of people who desire beautiful products. As TechCrunch put it, we allow store owners focus on what they do best: having beautiful offline experiences and selecting the right products for their customer base.",

Understanding of the role of load balancers and DNS, able to setup a basic infrastructure with some direction.\n* Experience having designed at least one API or subset of functionality from scratch. Able to discuss needs from both server side implementation and client side needs.\n* Experience working with CI/CD, able to discuss different testing approaches and have a good understanding of difference between things like unit/integration tests.\n* You’ve got experience testing applications, through unit, behaviour & integration tests. You understand that testing is essential to build robust applications and you’re experienced with setting up the appropriate test tooling to ensure rapid development and continuous deployment.\n* You’ve previously been exposed to at least one frontend production application and have a keen interest in learning more about building beautiful experiences for the end-user.\n\nBenefits\n\n* Competitive salary and share options in one of the UK’s most exciting startups.

We involve other people in what we’re doing early on to ensure we’re moving in the right direction and get feedback on our plans.\n\nWe want to be supported by the whole team, but ultimately be empowered to drive solutions as individuals. To gain this level of trust, we need to be confident that we gather the right requirements, we test to prove what we’ve built works and we test to ensure the result is robust. Furthermore, we document because we respect our future selves and team members.\n\nWe are open and transparent in the way we work. We expose our ideas and solutions early and follow the mantra that good is better than perfect. We invite others to challenge our ideas and help us achieve the best we can. This allows us be confident we deliver what is expected in the timeline we have proposed.\n\nWe’re one of the fastest growing companies in the world and we have wild ambitions. We thrive by delivering quality, impactful products at a fast pace, while improving how we work as a team. \n\nWHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR\n\nYou have a strong portfolio demonstrating a variety of work on web & mobile projects. Show us your understanding of interaction design, UX & UI principles and demonstrate how you have solved problems in the past.\n\nYou view the design process as a learning experience and you’re eager to dig deeper; understanding the root cause is your objective. You feel empowered to understand, question and iterate over what currently exists.\n \nYou’re able to jump straight into code if needed, HTML/CSS maybe even a bit of Javascript. Sometimes it’s just easier to prove a concept by code, other times you’re comfortable with prototyping or visualising your thoughts in Sketch (or similar software). \n\nYou’ve worked in a team with other engineers before and understand the basic principles of Git.\n\nYou’ve at least tinkered around with JQuery and/or some popular front-end frameworks out there (Ember.js, React or Angular).

Show us that you strive for team efficiency and creating outstanding experience for your users and that our product is definitely inspiring you.</p>\n\n<p>Benefits</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Competitive salary and share options in one of the UK’s most exciting startups.

At minimum you should be able to represent client side API needs\n\n* You write testable front-end code, and strongly believe that using test frameworks, unit, and acceptance tests are essential for building robust websites, enabling rapid development and continuous deployment.\n\nBenefits\n\n* Competitive salary and share options in one of the UK’s most exciting startups.
