  "description": "Not many people know, but conventional dry cleaning is extremely toxic. Despite its name, conventional dry cleaning is neither dry nor clean, as this process includes soaking the garments in solvent-based cleaners.\nAt BLANC, we want to change that. We believe that the world needs a sustainable and convenient way of cleaning the many clothes designers produce each year and that people want a trusted and caring partner to do this for them. A partner who understands that we need to make clothes last. BLANC is a natural artisan dry cleaner, tailor and launderer with award-winning stores in central London and a large Atelier in West London.\nSince launching in 2013 we have cleaned close to a million garments and served over 18,000 customers across London. As the UK’s fastest-growing natural garment care specialist, we are working with some of the most exciting fashion brands in the world. We are an innovative company with an entrepreneurial spirit and a great passion for everything we do.",
