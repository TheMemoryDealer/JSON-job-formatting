  "slogan": "Driving investment performance by improving decision-making",
  "description": "At Behaviour Lab we drive performance by working with asset managers, private equity firms, insurance companies and executive boards to identify where decision making is negatively impacted by unconscious bias.\n\nWe use analytics and behavioural science to assess performance, and apply new research and behavioural techniques to cultivate best practice.\n\nBiases and noise have been the cause of many costly missteps by companies and institutions in every sector. Asset managers lose on average losing 100bps annually from the endowment effect alone, insurance companies regularly showing 60% variance across underwriting and pricing decisions, and private equity firms are 30% more likely to default on deals due to decision-making biases.",
