  "description": "Pop & Rest is a tech-enabled wellbeing travel startup based in the vibrant Silicon Roundabout in London. \n\nWe connect people in large cities with peaceful and private sleep & meditation pods allowing them to  disconnect from busy places such as business districts, train stations and airports. Our single-occupancy pods are booked by the hour and controlled from our app. Using the app, users are able to personalise their experience through music, lighting and ambient sound.\n\nOur founders, Yoann Demont and Mauricio Villamizar, started the company in 2017 when they identified the need to have a quiet, peaceful, and private space to take naps in the City. Prior to launching Pop & Rest, Mauricio worked in Health Tourism and Yoann in Digital Consultancy. Obviously, they are both nap lovers! \n\nOur live booking website:https://popnrest.com\nOur blog:https://medium.com/@popnrest",
