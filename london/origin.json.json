  "description": "Origin’s software has transformed the debt capital markets, completely streamlining the way companies and investment banks work together to raise capital. Having launched just over 4 years ago, Origin is now used by over 20 investment banks and 80 borrowers in over 50 cities worldwide. Our clients include some of the largest investment banks and borrowers globally, including Barclays, Citi, and Telefonica. \n\nOur culture has helped us succeed where others have failed, in an industry that is famously resistant to change. We are a group of self-starters who are brave enough to take risks, and humble enough to learn from our mistakes. We know that our whole is greater than the sum of our parts, and we’re looking for like-minded individuals to join our team. ",
