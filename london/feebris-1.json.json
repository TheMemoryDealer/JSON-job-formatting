Diagnosing these conditions typically requires an experienced pulmonologist, blood tests and imaging, but Feebris’ software platform connects to existing medical sensors, and can be used intuitively by non-doctor users, outside the clinic, to detect respiratory issues early and avoid complications and hospitalisations. \n",
