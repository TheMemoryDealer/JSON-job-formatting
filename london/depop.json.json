We celebrate diversity and are committed to creating an inclusive environment for all employees.</p>\n\n<p>Depop recognises the benefits of a diverse workforce which reflects the wider population and welcomes applications from all sections of the community. Under the Equality Act (2010), Depop must demonstrate that their recruitment processes are fair and that we are not discriminating against or disadvantaging anyone because of their age, disability, gender reassignment status, marriage or civil partnership status, pregnancy or maternity, race, religion or belief, sex or sexual orientation. We need to ask applicants some questions to make sure that no one is being unfairly discriminated against or disadvantaged.</p>\n\n<p>We collect this information only for anonymised monitoring purposes to help the organisation look at the profile of individuals who apply, are shortlisted for and appointed to each vacancy. In this way, we can check that we are complying with the Equality Act (2010).</p>\n\n<p>Under the Equality Act 2010 the definition of disability is if you have a physical or mental impairment that has a &#39;substantial&#39; and &#39;long-term&#39; adverse effect on your ability to carry out normal day to day activities. Further information regarding the definition of disability can be found at: <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/definition-of-disability-under-equality-act-2010\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.gov.uk/definition-of-disability-under-equality-act-2010</a> Reasonable adjustments will be made available should you be invited to interview. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>GDPR Statement</strong></p>\n\n<p>When you apply to a job on this site, the personal data contained in your application will be collected by Depop Ltd, 08316342 (&quot;Controller&quot;), 9th Floor 107 Cheapside, London, United Kingdom, EC2V 6DN (“We”, “Us”) and can be contacted by emailing <a href=\"mailto:people@depop.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">people@depop.com</a>. Your personal data will be processed for the purposes of managing Controller’s recruitment related activities, which include setting up and conducting interviews and tests for applicants, evaluating and assessing the results thereto, and as is otherwise needed in the recruitment and hiring processes. Such processing is legally permissible under Art. 6(1)(f) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation) as necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the Controller, which are the solicitation, evaluation, and selection of applicants for employment.</p>\n\n<p>Your personal data will be shared with Greenhouse Software, Inc., a cloud services provider located in the United States of America and engaged by Controller to help manage its recruitment and hiring process on Controller’s behalf. Accordingly, if you are located outside of the United States, your personal data will be transferred to the United States once you submit it through this site.

You also have to right to data portability. In addition, you may lodge a complaint with an EU supervisory authority.</p>\n",
