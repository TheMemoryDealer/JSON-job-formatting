  "description": "​​You'll be working in a team responsible for surfacing the power of our AI models and state of the art data analysis methods by building web based applications. Our tools help our in-house scientists discover new medicines by by allowing them to run AI driven models and exploring the data beneath them. \n\nWe’re not a typical software company; we’re a drug discovery company. We generally don’t offer software for sale to external clients - rather we build complex tools that help our team of in-house scientists to make new discoveries in biomedicine.\n\nThis makes for interesting differences in the way our engineering team works. We can take feedback directly from our scientists (who are typically embedded in multidisciplinary squads), and we don’t have to worry about other constraints, such as supporting old web browsers.\n\nTLDR; we collaborate together to deliver reliable and novel new ways of computer-aided drug discovery.",

      "description": "What’s our vision?\n\nBenevolentAI, founded in 2013, is an advanced technology company focused on accelerating the journey from data to medicines. It is the world’s only technology company with end-to-end capability from early discovery to late stage clinical development.\n\nYou already are a Mid-Level/Senior Frontend software engineer looking to work on an exciting greenfield project: a web based platform for surfacing the power of our AI models and state of the art data analysis methods for scientists. Our goal is to bring together world-class Scientists and Machine Learning Researchers to accelerate the discovery of therapeutic treatments for human diseases. This is an ideal role if you are passionate about the Biomedical/ Medicinal Chemistry domains, user experience, data visualisation and machine learning, and if you would be excited by the opportunity to grow your skills in these areas.\n\nWe offer a great opportunity to explore and experiment with the state of the art tech stack and product to bring it to another level. You will also have the freedom to learn more within the role through regular in-house presentations and other training and develop your career in a highly challenging, but rewarding role.\n\n\nWhat’s your mission?\n\n* Work closely in an experienced cross functional team to help architect, iterate and deliver elegant solutions for a wide range of scientists.\n* Implement state of the art front end tools and applications for visualisation, introspection and interrogation of data.\n* Collaborate with Biologists, Data scientists, AI/Machine Learning researchers, bio and cheminformaticians, and Chemists. We are all passionate about maintaining a consistent user experience across our products and value a willingness to be actively involved in other non technical processes such as user and UX research.\n* Iterate rapidly based on user feedback and experiment with different ideas, without losing sight of engineering quality.\n* Be pragmatic and flexible - adapting your approach to work on hackathons, MVPs and long lived products.\n* Be willing to share and champion your opinion on technical direction, and contribute to the mix of ideas.\n* Mentor, and be mentored by, other members of the team. Partake in and facilitate workshops, retros and other project sessions.\n\nWhat do you need to succeed?\n\n* Extensive experience in front end web application development, with a genuine passion for elegant UI/UX solutions.\n* Strong attention to detail and a willingness to champion good design principles and translate them into code\n* Expertise in a range of technologies. The willingness to be flexible and humble matters more to us than experience in set technologies, although you might have experience in: Vue (or similar frameworks), Typescript, Javascript, Material design or other design languages, SCSS, Jest, Cypress, GraphQL\n* A knowledge of automated and manual testing approaches\n* Experience of Agile scrum, fast iterative environments, and version control.\n* You must be a strong communicator who can explain what is required to build and deliver great software products.\n\n\nAbout BenevolentAI\n\nBenevolentAI, founded in 2013, is an advanced technology company focused on accelerating the journey from data to medicines.
