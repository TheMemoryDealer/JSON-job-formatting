  "slogan": "We create software that automatically designs electronic circuit boards",
  "description": "Electronic circuit boards are at the core of current and future inventions, from augmented reality to autonomous vehicles. Yet today, designing an electronic circuit board is an extremely manual, long and tedious process. At Circuit Mind we are on a mission to solve this problem, shaping the future of hardware design.\n\nTaking inspiration from integrated circuit design, where high-level languages are used to automatically create complex circuits in silicon, we are building a novel software system that creates finished circuit board designs from high-level requirements. We are tackling hard problems that no one has ever solved before, pushing beyond what is currently thought to be possible.\n\nSeveral small and large engineering companies are waiting for Circuit Mind’s technology. We have the backing of world-class VC investors and we are building a tight-knit interdisciplinary team with outstanding technical abilities in electronic engineering, software engineering and algorithm design.",
