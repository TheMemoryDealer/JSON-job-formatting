  "description": "We've built one of the world's largest betting exchanges that provides significantly better odds than the competition.  Our strength is technology and trading, with a passion to push the known boundaries of real-time financial technology.\n\nOur platform that has handled over £15 billion worth of bets since launching in 2010, allowing us to become one of the most profitable companies per employee in Europe. In 2017 we were ranked in the top five of both the Sunday Times Tech Track 100 and Deloitte Fast 50.\n\nOur mission is to disrupt one of the oldest industries in the world by rethinking the betting business model. We believe traditional sports betting rips off bettors, taking up to a 15% margin on bets. We offer the industry's lowest margin of around 1%. We can and will do better.",
