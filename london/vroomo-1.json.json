  "description": "Vroomo replaces the used car salesman and the used car lot with a platform that connects buyers and sellers in a 21st century way. No haggling, no trips to the dealer or costly multiple trips to sellers homes, no expensive surprises – and no commission to the guy with the nice suit. Which means a better price for everyone.\n\nIf you're selling your car – just give us a few details and we will provide you with an immediate private price. We send an independent certified inspector to inspect your car at your home or workplace, finalize the private price, and – once it's sold we will deliver it to its new home. Plus, you will always get a higher offer than  the dealership.\n\nIf you're buying a Vroomo certified car –You get a car that has gone through a thorough 240 point independent check and has a clean history. You get a 7 day test drive - with free drive-away insurance-allowing you to return the vehicle within the 7 days for a full refund.\n\n\n\n",
