We knew generation rent would lead to more tenants, with higher digital expectations and we were confident we could provide a solution.\n\nAnd we did. Like all startups it’s been a bit of a roller coaster journey, but we’re now stronger than ever, with over 400 happy customers and exciting new products. We have ambitious plans for 2019 but with Mr William Reeve at the helm alongside co-founder Tom Mundy and a brilliant team of over 80 talented Goodlordians we are confident we’ll achieve these.\n\nOur values guide our decisions, the way we work, our culture and the people we ask to join the team. We work hard, have fun and support each other. We’re not afraid to make mistakes (we’d never learn if we didn’t) and we’re always looking to challenge ourselves. Our style is collaboration based on honesty, friendship and respect.\n\nIt’s an exciting time here at Goodlord. If you’re inspired by what we’re doing and share our values, we’d love to hear from you.\n\nWe’re looking for a creative Graphic designer to join our wonderful Marketing Team and help build something to get really excited about.\n\nAbout the role\n\nOur Marketing team has done a fantastic job of building a brand identity that speaks to and interests our customers. This is something our company is very proud of and sees as a massive opportunity: we are looking for someone to translate our tone of voice and culture into inspiring and eye-catching design - this will be your mission, should you chose to accept it!\n\nThis is a great opportunity to join a team where you're encouraged to take on as much responsibility as you can. You’ll have a high level of autonomy and creative authority. We’re constantly evolving, so no two days will be the same, and we’re looking for people who are comfortable working in a fast-paced environment.\n\nThe day to day stuff\n\nNo two days are ever the same at Goodlord so what you’ll be up to will vary. The pace we move at also means priorities will change and you’ll need to be comfortable with this (we’ll support you!). But these are the things that will be core to your role and will keep you busy.\n\n* You'll play a key part in shaping the visual elements of the growing Goodlord brand\n* You'll own all graphic design across the business from advertising content to customer brochures to even helping the product team with app illustrations. The role is varied with lots of opportunities to make an impact!\n* You’ll work with stakeholders from across the business to take a brief to a completed design project that all are proud of.\n* Most importantly, you'll be leading the conversation and brainstorms on how we present this information to all our audiences\n\nRequirements\n\nAbout you\n\n* You probably hold a degree in Arts and Graphic Design, or have relevant work experience\n* You’ve got experience working with different types of media (print, digital, multimedia, exhibition graphics, you name it!)\n* You have a proven ability to effectively and independently manage different projects at a time\n* You've got experience - or an interest to learn - in developing brand identity and have a strategic mindset\n* You can geek out over typography, layout and styling\n* Experience in website design would be a wonderful bonus but not essential\n\nBenefits\n\nWhy you'll love being a Goodlordian\n\nAside from the role, the people, our culture and our mission, we have some other things that make Goodlord a pretty awesome place to be…\n\n* Share our success: we know our success is a credit to our talented and hard-working team members so every Goodlordian has share options\n* Be rewarded: we love people who stand up and deliver and set the pace and we reward people for this with performance related pay\n* Your well-being matters: bi-weekly coaching with Sanctus to provide Goodlordians with a safe place to talk and support your mental health\n* Keep active: Footy Friday's, weekly yoga, cycling, standing desks. Whatever you like to do to keep fit and healthy we've got you covered\n* £1000 to learn: your development is important to us. Have a goal in mind? Share it with us. We guarantee you’ll learn loads and develop both personally and professionally at Goodlord, but it there’s something specific, you’ll have £1000 to spend on what’s important to you\n* Unlimited holiday and flexible time off: we encourage Goodlordians to make use of their unlimited time off to enjoy the world, recharge and reboot. We also offer time off for volunteering and training, so you can give back to the community and pursue your passions\n* Supporting your family: we offer Goodlordians of all genders a generous 3 months of fully-paid time off to look after their new arrivals\n* Quarterly team socials: a fun activity that everyone can take part in (if they want to!)\n* Friday drinks: what better way to relax and get to know the team than over a few drinks? We'll see you at the bar!\n* Four legged Goodlordians: we have a few resident pooches at Goodlord HQ who are always up for a walk / play if you need a break from your day\n* Our team: we’re an energetic, sociable and talented bunch who are super passionate about what we do and determined to make a difference.
