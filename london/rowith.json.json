  "description": "We are building Rowith, the first fitness app providing audio-guided rowing workouts to help people get the most out of the rowing machine. The best Olympic rowers, world champions and global personalities will help guide our members through each workout to reach their goals and make rowing fun.\n\nRowing can burn up to 800 calories an hour and is extremely effective in working your whole body from head to toe. Quads, hamstrings, back, abdominals, arms, shoulders, and calves are all used in the rowing stroke. Depending on how you train, you can increase your aerobic fitness or focus on building muscle strength and explosive power.\n\nRowing's efficiency and effectiveness, plus its reputation for being a low-impact workout for all ages and body types, has made it increasingly popular in gyms and fitness studios across the world!\n\nIf you need a comparison, think Nike Run Club for Rowing and body weight circuit training.",
