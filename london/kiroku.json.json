  "description": "Kiroku is changing the way computers understand conversational language. We believe that speech to text is not enough, and the next step is speech to meaning. Our first product can listen to a conversation between a dentist and a patient during a dental appointment and automatically generate the clinical notes. \n\nWe are backed by Entrepreneur First and some of the biggest names in both the startup and NLP ecosystems.",
