  "description": "Open Cosmos offers a combination of hardware, software and services that reduce technical complexity, paperwork and cost when developing satellite hosted payloads. \nWe provide a standardized nanosatellite (qbee) and a payload development tool (qbkit) that together with our web app (qbapp) allow ful mission development from payload conception in qbkit to in orbit control once launched in our qbee. This together with a comprehensive list of services (frequency allocation, insurance negotiation, export control, launch, GNC...) allow our customers to focus on what really adds value to their projects: their payload and the in orbit data. \nOpen Cosmos makes space technologies available to entrepreneurs, researchers and a broader range of organizations that will not only use them to run Earth Observation businesses, gain TRL of technologies in real space conditions, perform exploration or drive military surveillance but also to develop disruptive innovations that will shape our future.",
