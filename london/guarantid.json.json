Renting in the UK is tough - tenants are required to  have a clear UK credit file, spend at least 40% of their income on rent, and have a good rental record in the UK. Without these tenants are asked to find a UK based Guarantor or to pay 6-12 months rent in advance. That’s unfair, so we created guarantid.\n\nGuarantid is your ideal UK guarantor. With guarantid, tenants can rent their desired home, pay rent monthly, and avoid the burden of advance payment.. \n",
