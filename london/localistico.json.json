  "description": "Localistico helps brands bring more customers from Search to Store. \n\nThe way consumers look for and find physical locations is changing. What‚Äôs more, the growing influence of online channels on offline transactions brings new opportunities for retailers to better engage with customers, raise their local awareness and increase footfall.  \n\nWe believe that advances in geo targeting and analytics in platforms like Google and Facebook, plus the increasing digitalisation of bricks-and-mortar stores, brings new  opportunities to understand local customer behaviour and enhance business value. Localistico enables brands to take advantage of this opportunity.",

We have offices in central London, Madrid and Amsterdam - although our team works remotely most of the time (with quarterly in-person meetups).\n\nWe are building a local marketing and analytics platform to help marketing teams bridge online and offline. We believe that the way people find and interact with real-world locations is different from just websites. We think advances in geotargeting and analytics in platforms like Google and Facebook, plus the digitalization of brick & mortar locations will increasingly create new ways to reach customers and enhance business value - but will at the same time bring complexity. We are here to simplify that complexity.\n\nWe‚Äôre revenue-generating and manage location data across more than 80 countries for brands like Starbucks, Repsol or Vodafone. We have been part of Wayra and SeedRocket accelerators, were awarded a KPMG Shift100 Marketing Tech and are official partners of amazing digital players like Google, Apple or TripAdvisor. \n\nOur platform:\nLocalistico's backend is based on a mix of Ruby on Rails and Python components, the latter particularly for the data processing and integration pieces. Data storage is mostly PostgreSQL, Redis/Resque and ElasticSearch. Our frontend is built in Ember.js. Our whole deployment is cloud based with Shippable+Heroku+Google Cloud and continuous integration. We use GitHub as code repository and JIRA as management and issues platform.\n\nYour role:\nUnderstand our clients business, identify unique problems and unlock opportunities through bespoke technology solutions. \n\nYou will build new products and improve existing ones in collaboration with Localistico Product Engineering Team, developing solutions and tools to smooth, streamline, and ease the future integrations and reduce internal operational friction.\n\nMust have:\n- Ruby on Rails: High developer skills, working knowledge of Ruby on Rails and its ecosystem, having worked in sort-of-large Rails applications before and/or in a startup environment.\n- Communication: Experience communicating technical concepts to non-technical audiences. You got strong documentation habits.\n- Databases: Solid experience working with SQL databases and query optimisation, especially with PostgreSQL.\n- Way of working: A ‚Äúget things done‚Äù mindset always understanding the needs of the client. You are proactive, making the right diagnosis, proposing and executing efficient solutions. You're never afraid to get your hands dirty with code. Excellent at problem solving and a talent for identifying creative solutions\n- English. Good spoken/written English is a must. We use English for day-to-day chats, videoconferences and documentation so professional proficiency both spoken and written is required. Spanish as an extra would be great.\n- Timezone. Not more than 3 hours time zone difference from London (+/- 3 hours). We‚Äôre a distributed team but we have experienced issues in coordination when team members are more than 3 hours time difference from our normal timezone. So for now we‚Äôre discarding candidates that are too far away. Sorry if that‚Äôs your case, we hope to be able to revisit this at some point in the future.\n- Team member. We are building our team from the ground up, so we won't take into consideration agencies or externalisation of any kind. We hope you understand!\n\nüö®WARNING üö®\nWe are looking for someone very specific, so if you don‚Äôt meet the above requirements we will not be taking forward your application.\n\nNice to have:\n- Python and Django\n- Experience with the domain of the containers (Docker FTW!)\n- Experience developing a REST API following JSON API specification.\n- Working knowledge of Heroku, Amazon Web Service or Google Cloud\n- Well-rounded experience in software development and in back-end development as part of a team doing code reviews in a pull request of a team mate or pair programming, as well as updating/maintaining other team members‚Äô code.\n- Having worked in sort-of-large Rails applications before and/or in a startup environment would be good for extra brownie points, but not mandatory.\n\nWe‚Äôre looking for the type of person that is always learning and feeling ready to take new challenges (despite it being scary sometimes!). \n\nWhat we offer:\n- Work in a professional team full of diversity: As part of our growth we are creating different teams to deal with the development of improvements and integrations in parallel. You‚Äôll be part of a small team where everyone counts!\n- Flexible location and hours: we are a distributed team and we plan by goals, not times - work from wherever you are happiest and feel most productive. For when you need an office, you'll have them in London and Madrid.\n- Creative work: don‚Äôt just execute to guidelines but be a defining part of a great team tackling an interesting problem and help us drive the solution and the company culture.\n- We want all our team members to be healthy, grow and develop so we offer perks to cover the costs of gym classes or other sporty pursuits, language learning, conferences and other areas.\n- Competitive salary (41K‚Ç¨-62K‚Ç¨) + bonuses and equity participation (employee stock options scheme), based on location and experience.
