  "slogan": "Ethical alternative to payday loans and overdraft fees in the UK",
  "description": "Because of infrequent payroll cycles in the UK, our users are forced to rely on expensive solutions like payday loans or overdraft fees to afford recurring purchases such as groceries or phone bills. This problem is more pronounced for UK consumers than for US consumers because paychecks are even more infrequent than the typical 2 week cycle in the US (a large portion of our users get paid every 4 weeks or the last weekday of every month). We give our users an inexpensive alternative to payday loans or overdraft fees by offering small cash advances up to two weeks before their payday, completely interest and fee free. Instead, they decide if they would like to give us a tip for our services.",
