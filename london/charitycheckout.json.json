  "description": "Our Purpose:\nWe strengthen relationships between charities and their supporters. Every day hundreds of thousands of people get together to do brilliant things for good causes. Whether they are running a charity, a cake stall or a half marathon, they’re doing something to make our world a bit better and we believe that should be celebrated. Every charity needs to connect personally with their supporters and make every relationship count. Nothing should ever get between your charity and your supporters.\n\nThe Product:\nCharity Checkout provides branded and personalised online fundraising products. Our award-winning tech helps charities engage their supporters directly on their own fundraising platform, putting them in control of their online fundraising, data and supporter relationships. Removing the need for complex payments tech, merchant accounts, website developers and fiddly Gift Aid admin, we offer an easier way for charities to accept online donations directly under their own brand.",
