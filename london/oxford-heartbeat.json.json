  "description": "We develop a software platform that provides an unprecedented and truly unique visibility in cutting-edge keyhole surgeries. It allows surgeons to see what is happening inside blood vessels in real time, how devices interact with arterial walls, and travel through tissues and bones. \n\nWith our technology, surgeons can rehearse procedures and select the optimal scenario for every individual patient before they go into the operating theatre, reducing complication rates and associated costs.",
