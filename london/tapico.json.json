  "description": "Tapico brings the benefits of open banking to the entire wealth management spectrum by building tools that connect a disparate financial landscape. Our universal API provides access to a range of financial data, enabling companies to enhance their offering to the market by building on top of payment account data, balances, transactions, and payment initiation functionality.\n\nThe flexibility of our platform allows the capture and management of end-user consents to be applied to any third party application a financial institution has contracted with directly. Helping propositions extend beyond open banking whilst maintaining a consistency of security and user experience.",
