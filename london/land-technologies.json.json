Our flagship product, Landinsight, helps property developers understand the development potential of any plot of land within seconds. Our tech has changed the game and as a result we’ve become the UK’s fastest growing PropTech company (it’s official, we’ve got the awards to prove it!).\n\nIn the last 12 months alone, we have grown from 12 employees to 48. Our user base is doubling regularly and already, tens of thousands of homes have been built on sites that were sourced using Landinsight and that’s just the beginning.\n\nThe next few years are going to be huuuuuge as we start building out the rest of our vision to enable everyone to take the next step on their property development journey. This vision is backed by the same investors behind Love Film, TransferWise, Zoopla, Shazaam and Property Partner.\n\nReal issues, real tech, underpinned by a real economic opportunity. That’s LandTech.\n\nOur Values and Culture\n\nWe truly believe that businesses flourish when people work collaboratively. That’s why we prioritise team building and facilitation. You’ll also be in constant contact with the company founders, so you can learn about the conception of and running of a startup company that is scaling up. We run weekly sessions to ensure every voice is heard and empowered to grow and contribute.\n\nWe don’t just make empty gestures about our culture - we were voted as the 3rd best UK SaaS Company to work at, and have also received awards for ‘Diversity Advocate’ and ‘Best at Employee Development’.\n\nOur company values are ‘open’, ‘empower’ and ‘home’ and we regularly hold ourselves accountable to these. The people who work here feel that are challenged, but also feel like they have the environment and tools to succeed. Glassdoor backs this up.\n\nYour Mission\n\nOur Customer Success Team is a crucial area of our business and a vital component to our growth plans.\n\nNot to be confused with Customer Support, a Customer Success Manager is responsible for building and maintaining lasting relationships with clients by providing clear strategic success plans to our enterprise accounts alongside expert training, guidance, and advice to ensure that Landinsight becomes the must-have tool within their business, helping them grow and achieve their objectives and return on investment.\n\nIt’s a fantastic role that is both challenging yet rewarding and will allow you to develop and grow and have a real influence in the direction of our team.\n\nWith no sales driven targets, your main focus, infact, your ONLY focus, is making your customers successful.\n\nExperience isn’t necessary, we can help you with that but what you do need is a proactive, confident, professional approach with a real passion for helping our customers achieve success.\n\nYou need to be enthusiastic about what you do and be a real people person, able to deal with different types of people at all levels and confident delivering training and presentations to large audiences.\n\nYou have to be organised, diligent and creative in your approach engaging your clients and continuing to add on going value and support.\n\nCulture is important, it’s a huge part of who we are.

But we’ve grown a lot since then.\n\nIn fact, we’re the fastest-growing PropTech company in the UK. And PropTech just happens to be one of the fastest-growing sectors in the UK too.\n\nWith the level of confidence the co-founders put into each hire, and the support they offer along the way, you get the opportunity to learn fast, skill up, and develop an incredible career.\n\n\nAbout the role\n\nAs LandTech’s first product marketer your mission is to help those interested in LandTech understand how we can help them reach the results they seek. You will empower the entire company to rally behind the same messaging by providing battle cards and enablement materials that allow them to better communicate with prospects and users.\n\nBy working with the rest of the Marketing team you will also ensure our current users get the most out of their subscriptions by creating educational content about product best practice, as well as deliver the content to them using a range of marketing channels.\n\nUltimately, your goal is to supercharge LandTech’s growth by bringing new users to our platform and making sure they see the benefits of staying with us for many years to come.\n\nKey responsibilities\n\n* Coordinate Product Launches – Work with the Product department and the Marketing teams to determine the positioning of products and features, identify the channels to communicate launches on, and create the content needed for all channels, whether the target is a current or potential user.\n* Lead the creation of Product Content – Identify what product content we need across the customer lifecycle and take ownership of the creation and execution to ensure customers are receiving the right message at the right time.\n* Drive Product Adoption - Create strategies for amplifying our product content through our marketing channels and automation to drive key product usage across the customer lifecycle. Regularly review the effectiveness of said strategies to drive the right behaviour and leverage a/b testing to continuously improve their impact.\n\nOur culture\n\nEverything we do is underpinned by our three core values: Open, Empower, Home.\n\nWe believe that businesses (and people) do their best work when they’re working collaboratively. That means you’ll be working directly with everyone in the business, right up to the co-founders Jonny and Andrew.\n\nRead more about who we are, and how we work, here (https://workable.com/nr?l=https%3A%2F%2Fland.tech%2Fabout%2F) .\n\nIt’s this attitude that saw us voted the 3rd best UK SaaS Company to work for, and receive awards for ‘Best at Employee Development’.\n\nWe want the best people. And we offer some great perks to get (and keep) them.\n\nRequirements\n\n* Past Product Marketing Success – You don't need to have years of Product Marketing experience but you can prove past success in leading product marketing activities and campaigns.\n* Communication Expertise – You are a master at converting technical products and features into end user benefits. Contextualisation of the communication to a specific target audience and communication format (presentation, video, help article etc) is something you have done before.\n* Project Coordination Experience - You are used to bringing together input from several stakeholders and successfully coordinate projects to deliver on the desired business result.\n\n\nGreat-to-haves\n\n* Past Video Creation Experience - The best way to teach someone about a product and how to use it is via video, and even though we have a creative team it is highly beneficial for you to be able to create product demo/help videos on your own to drive product awareness/engagement.\n* Knowledge of Hubspot, Drift, Appcues or similar – Automation is your bread and butter. These are the core tools we're currently using to automate product related marketing and knowledge of them will help you be more independent and able to execute on product marketing activites end-to-end. We're open to others if you have suggestions, but these will be your starting point.\n\nBenefits\n\n\n* Competitive salary and equity options\n* Flexible working hours\n* 25 days paid holiday (plus bank holidays)\n* Unlimited unpaid holiday\n* Professional and personal training budget\n* Gift vouchers for buying your first home, tying the knot and having a baby\n* Gym and wellness contributions\n* Cycle-to-work scheme\n* Dog-friendly office\n* An inclusive community – sharing time in an annual ski trip, all-company quarterly away days, and monthly socials\n* Dedication to hiring for cultural fit, so you know you’re going to be sitting next to someone who is decent, passionate about what they do, and eager to learn and grow",

You will empower the entire company to rally behind the same messaging by providing battle cards and enablement materials that allow them to better communicate with prospects and users.</p>\n\n<p>By working with the rest of the Marketing team you will also ensure our current users get the most out of their subscriptions by creating educational content about product best practice, as well as deliver the content to them using a range of marketing channels.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, your goal is to supercharge LandTech’s growth by bringing new users to our platform and making sure they see the benefits of staying with us for many years to come.</p>\n\n<p>Key responsibilities</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Coordinate Product Launches – Work with the Product department and the Marketing teams to determine the positioning of products and features, identify the channels to communicate launches on, and create the content needed for all channels, whether the target is a current or potential user.</li>\n<li>Lead the creation of Product Content – Identify what product content we need across the customer lifecycle and take ownership of the creation and execution to ensure customers are receiving the right message at the right time.</li>\n<li>Drive Product Adoption - Create strategies for amplifying our product content through our marketing channels and automation to drive key product usage across the customer lifecycle. Regularly review the effectiveness of said strategies to drive the right behaviour and leverage a/b testing to continuously improve their impact.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Our culture</p>\n\n<p>Everything we do is underpinned by our three core values: Open, Empower, Home.</p>\n\n<p>We believe that businesses (and people) do their best work when they’re working collaboratively. That means you’ll be working directly with everyone in the business, right up to the co-founders Jonny and Andrew.</p>\n\n<p>Read more about who we are, and how we work, here (<a href=\"https://workable.com/nr?l=https%3A%2F%2Fland.tech%2Fabout%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://workable.com/nr?l=https%3A%2F%2Fland.tech%2Fabout%2F</a>) .</p>\n\n<p>It’s this attitude that saw us voted the 3rd best UK SaaS Company to work for, and receive awards for ‘Best at Employee Development’.</p>\n\n<p>We want the best people. And we offer some great perks to get (and keep) them.</p>\n\n<p>Requirements</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Past Product Marketing Success – You don&#39;t need to have years of Product Marketing experience but you can prove past success in leading product marketing activities and campaigns.</li>\n<li>Communication Expertise – You are a master at converting technical products and features into end user benefits. Contextualisation of the communication to a specific target audience and communication format (presentation, video, help article etc) is something you have done before.</li>\n<li>Project Coordination Experience - You are used to bringing together input from several stakeholders and successfully coordinate projects to deliver on the desired business result.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Great-to-haves</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Past Video Creation Experience - The best way to teach someone about a product and how to use it is via video, and even though we have a creative team it is highly beneficial for you to be able to create product demo/help videos on your own to drive product awareness/engagement.</li>\n<li>Knowledge of Hubspot, Drift, Appcues or similar – Automation is your bread and butter. These are the core tools we&#39;re currently using to automate product related marketing and knowledge of them will help you be more independent and able to execute on product marketing activites end-to-end. We&#39;re open to others if you have suggestions, but these will be your starting point.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Benefits</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Competitive salary and equity options</li>\n<li>Flexible working hours</li>\n<li>25 days paid holiday (plus bank holidays)</li>\n<li>Unlimited unpaid holiday</li>\n<li>Professional and personal training budget</li>\n<li>Gift vouchers for buying your first home, tying the knot and having a baby</li>\n<li>Gym and wellness contributions</li>\n<li>Cycle-to-work scheme</li>\n<li>Dog-friendly office</li>\n<li>An inclusive community – sharing time in an annual ski trip, all-company quarterly away days, and monthly socials</li>\n<li>Dedication to hiring for cultural fit, so you know you’re going to be sitting next to someone who is decent, passionate about what they do, and eager to learn and grow</li>\n</ul>\n",
