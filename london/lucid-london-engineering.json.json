  "description": "Lucid is building a platform for carrying out programmatic research on the internet.\n\nThe current business primarily focusses on the Market Research industry, however, we are rapidly diversifying across all forms of research, from academic research to political polling, to AI training.\n\n Our core business is providing a programmatic marketplace platform for enterprise market research.  We are in the process of expanding the capabilities of that core platform to allow access to market research to anyone.  In addition, are access to the world’s largest repository of questions asked and answered gives us an opportunity to expand into adjacent businesses as well.\n\nCurrently, we answer over a million questions per day, and in 2019 we will multiply this, transforming our business and the industry in both speed and scale.",
