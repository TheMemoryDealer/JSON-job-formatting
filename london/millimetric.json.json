  "description": "At Millimetric, we’re revolutionising the way global organisations analyse their most mission-critical business insights. Even the smallest metrics can make the biggest difference in what is becoming an increasingly digital world and so we’ve built a ground-breaking tool that analyses business data around the clock and spots anomalies in business performance the second they occur. We like to think of it as supercharging E-Commerce Technology and Martech by helping them to do a thorough job, at speed and hassle-free!\n\nNow a little about our success so far. We’ve had investment from Global Founders Capital, who have backed the likes of Revolut, Hello Fresh and Skyscanner, as well as investment from Seedcamp who get behind world class entrepreneurs. Our clients include Clinique, Mac, Domino’s, Samsung and Toyota, just to name a few and our customer base is growing daily, hence why we’re on the hunt for fresh new talent to join our already established team.",
