  "description": "We believe that speech is the fundamental means of human communication. All cultures persuade, inform and build relationships primarily through speech. Voice user interface has exploded in popularity over the recent years where speech recognition technology enables users to communicate with technology with their voice only.  \nWe have developed a state of the art speaker identification system that identifies people via their voice only. We know who you are regardless of dialect, language and both through free speech and short pre-learned phrases. To improve the quality of voice user interfaces we need to develop machines capable of comprehending not only context but also other information like stress and emotion with a better understanding of user intention based on the identity and profile of a speaker. \n",
