  "description": "Pirical, formerly Aspirant Analytics, was launched in 2015. Our past experiences range from corporate careers in McKinsey, Bloomberg, and Goldman Sachs to recent graduates of leading UK universities and European business schools.\n\nOur customers are top international legal and professional services firms, excited by the power of data for managing their business.\n\nWe work with business leaders who are hungry for better ways of deciding where to focus attention, how to stand apart from the competition, and how to maximise their impact.\n\nWe obsess over the decisions our customers need to make next and develop products to guide their thinking.\n\nWe have grown organically into a company of nearly 30. Our customers love what we do; we provide them with evidence and tools to reduce bias, to work more efficiently and to pursue new growth opportunities.",
