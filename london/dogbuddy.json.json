  "slogan": "Your Perfect Dog Sitter",
  "description": "With our iOS & Android Apps and Website, we help busy dog owners find local and reliable dog sitters to take care of their dogs whilst they’re away from home. Through building long lasting relationships online, we make it easier and more convenient for owners to work, rest or play!\n\nWe believe that all dogs (and their owners!) should have the freedom to enjoy their lives. Whether that means taking a two week trip of a lifetime, or making time for date night with a loved one, we think that owning a dog shouldn’t get in the way of your day-to-day.\n\nDogBuddy was founded in 2013 by passionate entrepreneurs Richard Setterwall (CEO) and Enrico Sargiacomo (COO) after they each struggled to find a sitter for their own dogs.\n\nSince then, we have now grown to be Europe’s leading online dog sitting and home dog boarding community, offering one of the first “airbnb style services” for dogs in the UK, Spain, Italy, France, Germany and Sweden.\n\n",
