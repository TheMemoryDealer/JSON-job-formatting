We focus on solving core data processing pain points in real estate, and believe that unstructured data is a key barrier to digital transformation in the industry.\n\nPRODA is combining real estate expertise with data science to develop machine\nleaning-enabled software, with the aim of truly automating many analysis and\nreporting tasks for real estate professionals. Our software automatically captures\nproperty data from spreadsheets, before standardising, error-checking & securely\nstoring it. This enables users to standardise and access all their data, regardless of\nthe country, asset class or company that it originated from.\n\nTo find out more, please visit www.proda.ai",
