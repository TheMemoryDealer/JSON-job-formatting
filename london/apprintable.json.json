  "description": "We are a team of creatives that have come together using our knowledge of client service and global supply chain management.\n\nWe understand the need for speed and better, more transparent pricing in the print and design industry and the lack of personalised service with our competitors.\n\nThe main reason our current client list extends to names such as Jagermeister, FIFA & Mars inc. is down to how we work with clients to understand their needs and help them reduce wastage in time and money.\n\nWe have created efficient ways for us to help clients manage their print such as Toolkits, our signature platform to allow clients to use fixed branded templates to order print for their companies across multiple departments.\n\nOther tools currently in development include a proofing system to allow customers to see their products on a mockup, automated proofing and correcting on upload to save time, and a new product plan stretching with a range of over 1000 products.",
