We have raised capital from top technology investors in the UK and one of the world's largest banks.\n\nWe use cutting-edge technology and lashings of innovation to create affordable, ethical and transformative products that make life better for flexible workers.\n\nOur first product, the Wollit Income Promise, is an income stability tool that enables people to take home the same amount every month - even if their hours and earnings fluctuate. But we're not stopping there. We plan to disrupt any area of finance where flexible workers don't have access to the services they need and deserve.\n\nIf you thrive in a fast-paced, high-energy, mission-driven environment - our small but rapidly growing team may be just the place for you!",
