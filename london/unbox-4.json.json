We are a team of multi-national multi-disciplinary entrepreneurs dedicated to our vision. If something were to sum up Unbox in a nutshell, it would be our beliefs.\n\n1 - We believe in equal opportunity because it is the only guarantee for lasting peace.\n2 - We challenge the idea that labour and capital should always be rewarded in capital.\n3 - We adhere to the logic that governments and employers should positively reward desired changes in behaviour.\n4 - We believe \"helicopter money\" does not work to (re)activate economic activity and desired consumption.\n\nWe build and protect purchasing power\nthrough people-centered concepts, software, and solutions. \n",
