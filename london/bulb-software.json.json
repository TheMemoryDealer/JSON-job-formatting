  "slogan": "Helping growing businesses manage their physical assets in an easy and affordable way",
  "description": "Here's the thing, companies finance many physical assets that cost them money if they don't track them well. The problem is, once they've reached a number of assets (typically more than 50 assets) trying to do this with paperwork or excel spreadsheets becomes a nightmare! \n\nOur Virtual Asset Manager platform, BulbThings, helps customers with 3 main things:\n1- Consolidate all data about their assets in one place and keep a history of everything (e.g. location, events, costs) \n2- Automate many tasks (e.g. allocation/booking of assets, tracking maintenances and jobs, renewals at end of life etc) and work more efficiently\n3- Get action-oriented smart alerts and real-time analytics from many sources of data (IoT sensors, customer input, suppliers data, external APIs etc.). We use machine learning and automated workflows to make more accurate recommendations and take automated actions for our customers.\n\nFRESH NEWS: We're just about to launch a complete new version of our product (check out our Twitter for announcements). We'll also be making our API and SDK available to 3rd party developers and partners.",
