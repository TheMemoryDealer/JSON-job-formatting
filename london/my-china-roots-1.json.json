  "description": "We help overseas Chinese trace their ancestry, connect with lost relatives, and travel to their ancestral villages in China.\n\nGenealogy is a 4+bn USD industry that largely ignores 150 million Overseas Chinese. Already leading in bespoke family history research and travel services, we are building the world’s first Online Platform & Database to empower millions to connect with their Chinese roots. \n\nJoin us as game changers in Chinese genealogy and cultural identity, using Optical Character Recognition and Artificial Intelligence to connect family histories and new-found relatives!",
