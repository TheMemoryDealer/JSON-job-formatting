  "slogan": "Connecting Neurodiverse talent pools to inclusive employers",
  "description": "Purpose\nOver 100,000 neurodiverse young adults turn 18 every year. A large percentage are not entering employment due to lack of innovation, training, and  accessibility to career pathways and  employment opportunities, Neuropool was founded to help address this. \n\nOur belief is that neurodiverse individuals should be profiled on what attributes & skills they have that could lead to employment, this should be identified from childhood at school and continue through college and further education through to the early stages of their career. Our purpose is to help employers better understand neurodiversity in the workplace and to reduce the time it takes to find & retain talent. \n\n\nNeurpool ltd is a platform built to connect talent pools of neurodiverse students to inclusive  employers through the use of technology and skill set  matching.\n",
