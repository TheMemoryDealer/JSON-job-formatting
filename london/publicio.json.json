The global govtech market is worth £320bn, but startups struggle to access it. \n\nLed by ex-deputy head of the No.10 policy unit, Daniel Korski, and venture investor, Alexander de Carvalho, Public’s team has operational experience of government, startups, technology and finance, to help startups do business successfully with the public sector.\n\nIn March 2017, we launched applications to GovStart, a growth programme based in London to get startups ready for the public sector, and help them through the sales cycle.\n\nThe Public team will build an individual programme for every startup joining GovStart depending on their product, market, knowledge gaps and time commitment. \n\n Visit our website (public.io) to find out more.",
