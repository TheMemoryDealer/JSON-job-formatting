  "description": "We’re passionate about great clothes, but we’re also concerned about fashion’s waste problem.  So we created Onloan, a fashion membership service. We loan our customers standout premium clothes, for work & the weekend, on a monthly subscription. \n\nWe launched in Summer 2019, and already work with some of the best contemporary brands, from Alexa Chung to Mother of Pearl. Our wonderful investors include leaders at AngelList, Farfetch, Trouva, Bulb, and Uber. We’ve been featured in The Times Magazine, Elle, Grazia,  The Telegraph and Courier.\n\nThe founders, Tamsin & Natalie, are two friends with a shared ambition to reignite a love of clothes without the guilt.  Tamsin’s experience is at Bain, in startups and in impact investment, whilst Natalie worked for Mario Testino, beauty company 3ina, and brands ranging from Chloe to John Lewis.  We’re a business brain and a creative brain, and are building a company that values diversity of thought. ",

We’re looking for a product engineer who shares our vision and can evolve our low-/ no-code strategy. Our immediate focus is on automation to save time and continue scaling the business. In the medium term we are focused on smarter personalisation and a slick user journey.\n\nOur existing Shopify site works well for now, but we need to start planning early for the next stage. How we go about it will be driven by what our customers need. A crucial part of your role will be helping us to define this in the short, medium and long term.\n\n\nPriorities will include:\n\n- Iterating on the existing Shopify site: work with the team to speak to users, prioritise new features, build them, understand which ones work well and which don’t, iterate again.\n- Link our current software tools together seamlessly; automate tasks that are currently manual & time-consuming - or implement better software\n- Build the next level of our inventory management systems using RFID tags and scanning technology\n- Build out our customer database, pulling together the extensive customer data inputs we get from multiple channels to power first-class customer service and personalisation\n- Help define Onloan’s product strategy, and work with experts and advisors to put this into action.\n- Manage freelancers where necessary to build sections of the product that require more capacity and/or specific expertise\n\n\nAbout you:\n\n- Excited about designing and scaling a new product that’s cool and does good!\n- Interested in more than “just the product”, keen to get involved with brand, strategy and marketing.\n- Familiar with low-code and no-code software tools\n- Experience working with external / remote development teams\n- Enjoys experimenting and iterating fast, and can be pragmatic about balancing speed of execution over perfection\n- Experience measuring impact of new features\n- Ideally, experience building either a consumer subscription product, and/or a fashion company\n\nIf you tick some but not all of these boxes, but are really eager to teach yourself new skills on the job, please apply.
