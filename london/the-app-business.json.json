  "description": "Technology is mobile. After a decade of the smartphone, mobile technology continues to connect people, data and things - anytime, and everywhere. This continues to unlock extraordinary opportunities, empowering both businesses and individuals to fulfil their outcomes faster.\n\nThe result? Better, more responsive operations, services and experiences - and a new standard for what ‘great’ looks like. The challenge, however, is a landscape of increasing technical complexity and a new tide of expectation that is reshaping every industry on earth.\n\nTAB is a highly focused technology partner, built to enable organisations to thrive in a world where mobile is an expectation – not a device. \n",

      "description": "About TAB:\n\nTAB's purpose is simple: to create products that make the world work better. It’s a lofty one, but when we inject our mobile specialism into some of the biggest companies in the world, we create game-changing products.\n\nAs the biggest team of mobile specialists in the world (over 500 people globally and over 150 in London), we believe that the opportunity for our team is increasingly exciting, as we see user experiences unbundle from smartphones into a multitude of emerging platforms and touchpoints such as cars, speakers and wearables.\n\nWe are now expanding our offering and opening up an office in Edinburgh, become one of the pioneers for our new move!\n\nThe Senior iOS Engineer role in a nutshell:\n\nAs a Senior Engineer, you'll be at the heart of any project you work on. You’ll have a specialism in iOS but use much broader technical experience to help steer your project team. You may bring a unique depth of knowledge in a specific topic, or you may have a breadth of expertise across many aspects of software development.\n\nYou’ll work with some of the world’s largest organisations, such as Tesco, RBS, Shell and Ford, to help define how they use mobile to drive their businesses. You’ll share your passion and experience with those around you, allowing and encouraging your less experienced teammates to step up.\n\nAt a senior level, your remit reaches beyond your project. Teammates in our internal iOS community will naturally look to you for on-the-job coaching and broader career advice. Your success will be largely based on the success of those you influence.\n\nAt TAB, you will become a great leader in your field. You’ll be encouraged to work with others to shape TAB’s mobile proposition for new clients and grow our in-house team of mobile experts.\n\nWhat you can expect:\n\nYou’ll join our growing team of 15+ iOS engineers who all share your passion for building great apps.\n\nYou’ll benefit from knowledge sharing sessions across the business, such as the iOS team’s weekly super.init() meeting.\n\nYou’ll build market-leading products, typically leading a team of 2-3 other iOS engineers.\n\nYou’ll help shape your product’s roadmap by taking part in all aspects of project planning and delivery.\n\nYou’ll contribute to our continued growth by helping identify and interview great new teammates.\n\nThe type of person we would love to meet:\n\nYou are a passionate, self-motivated engineer who builds iOS apps with Swift.\n\nYou will bring valuable experience on topics such as UI, concurrency, persistence and architectural approaches (MVC, MVP, etc.)\n\nYou are excited about the opportunity to work on a variety of projects.\n\nYou seek opportunities to share your knowledge and experience with others.\n\nYou are committed to writing high quality, testable code.\n\nYou enjoy collaborating as an Agile team.\n\nYou are comfortable reviewing other people’s work and suggesting improvements.\n\nYou are eager to contribute to TAB’s Engineering culture and take advantage of what’s on offer.\n\n \n\nTAB believes in creating a culture where diversity, regardless of its form, is just a part of who we are. We empower every TABber to share what matters to them, subsequently creating a culture where every person, regardless of race, religion, colour, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, or disability status, is treated as a valued member of TAB!",
