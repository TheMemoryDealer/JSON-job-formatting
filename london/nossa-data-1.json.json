This is a rapidly growing field that we expect will evolve significantly in the coming 5-10 years. We believe by building technology to serve companies in their reporting process, we can help create a more sustainable planet. \r\n\r\n**The Role:**\r\n\r\nWe are an early stage start-up and are in the process of securing initial funding. This will be our first full time hire to support this next stage of company growth and will include an equity offer. Specifically, you will be working with the co-founders to onboard our pilot customers to prepare our product for a large seed round during Q4 of 2020. \r\n\r\nWe are looking for someone interested in joining an early stage start-up with big growth goals but who is specifically specialized in ESG / Corporate ESG reporting. You are familiar with GRI, TFCD, CDP, SDGs, MSCI, Sustainalytics, SASB and more. You’ve helped at a company level or on by conducting ESG due diligence as an investor. You understand the nuances of reporting and see the gap in the market. \r\n\r\nOn top of ESG, we expect you to be excited about joining an early stage technology start-up with ambitious plans. We expect you to come ready to drive initiatives and share ideas and we intend to support you with our rapidly growing list of advisors across ESG, technology, start-ups and academia. \r\n\r\n**About the founders:** \r\n\r\nNossa Data’s founders met at Antler London. Julianne Sloane, the co-founder and CEO, has spent her career at various fintech start-ups focused on growth. She has been an early hire at venture backed fintechs and helped build products from scratch in both B2B and B2C. She also writes a [weekly newsletter](nossa.capital) on responsible investment and has conducted research on the ESG strategy of some of the UKs largest pension schemes and funds. Irina, the co-founder and CTO has spent 4 years working at Google as a software engineer and SRE at Google focused on reliability and security. Irina holds a Combined Bachelor's and Masters in Computing (Software Engineering) from Imperial College London. She is well connected with top-technologists in the UK and abroad. \r\n\r\n**How to apply:** \r\n\r\nIn your application we want to see that you are passionate about growing a tech business focused on ESG. We also want to see a demonstration that you are a person who takes initiative both in how you get in touch with us and how you will collaborate with a rapidly growing team and customer base. Please email us your introduction to team@nossadata.com and we will schedule calls with relevant candidates. \r\n\r\nIf you do not have the relevant background for this role but are interested in what we are building at Nossa Data, please get in touch as well.
