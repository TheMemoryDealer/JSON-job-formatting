  "description": "Ai Build is a London based company developing Artificial Intelligence and Advanced Additive Manufacturing technologies for the built environment. Ai Build's large scale robotic 3D printing technology allows designers, architects and engineers to manufacture large, complex forms very quickly and cost effectively by reducing material waste and eliminating human labour.\n\nOur goal is to provide an end-to-end 3D printing solution to customers which includes both the hardware to realise the physical printing process and the software to control it. Something we continually strive for is complete automation of this process. To achieve this we invest significant efforts into state of the art computer vision and machine learning techniques which work in tandem with our highly generalised toolpath planning algorithms.",
