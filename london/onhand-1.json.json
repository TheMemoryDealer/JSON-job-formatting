  "slogan": "We're a Tech for Good start-up that makes giving help easy and getting help affordable",
  "description": "Our platform matches trusted locals with older adults who need help with everyday tasks. Shopping, tech help, a cup of tea and a chat. The kind of things over-stretched friends and family or expensive professional carers are relied on for today. Getting help for the simple things shouldn’t be hard or expensive - that’s why we’re here.\n\nLaunched in March 2019, we've graduated from Facebook's LND_LABS accelerator, signed up 3500+ volunteers and delivered over 1500 hours of help to 100's of older adults in London. In our second year, we'd like to reach 1000's of older adults and expand to more areas in the UK. We'll only achieve this through Tech enablement.\n\nhttps://apps.apple.com/gb/app/onhand/id1367396948",
