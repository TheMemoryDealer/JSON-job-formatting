  "description": "At Improbable, we believe that simulations as large and complex as the real world are the next fundamental breakthrough technology. Like in the real world, objects in these simulations will change in response to their environment, and their interactions will combine to form massive, complex systems.\n\nWe are building the platform to make these simulations possible.\n\nNew worlds for gaming and entertainment can now be created using our product, SpatialOS. Our technology creates permanent, persistent and engaging experiences: worlds where your actions really matter. The same technology that makes imaginary worlds feel real can also illuminate complex systems at work in reality. We use insight acquired through simulation to solve real world problems.\n\nYou can find out more about our technology on our website - improbable.io ",
