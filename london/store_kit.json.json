  "description": "A better way to buy POS. Sell more in-store, online and on-the-go with StoreKit. Storekit supplies point-of-sale hardware, accessories, software selection advice and payment processing to small and medium size merchants.\n\nIn more details...\n\nStoreKit.com is a platform for the point-of-sale (POS) industry. POS is what allows merchants to run their business and accept payments in their store, restaurant etc. The POS market is undergoing a massive transition towards more efficient, cloud based systems. iZettle and Square are the big names but only a small part of what is happening out there. While competition is intense between sellers, the offering remains complex/confusing for the buyers who end up buying the wrong things. It's a broken market.\n\nStoreKit solves this by helping merchants choose the right tech and partners with the major software and payment companies to help them grow their customer base.\n",
