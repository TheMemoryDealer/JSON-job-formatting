      "description": "OUTSOURCING COMPANIES PLEASE SKIP THIS ONE. THANKS\n\nDear Engineer, It is a pleasure to introduce you to this very special opportunity at our ambitious and demanding new enterprise / startup.\n\nCo-Founder / Developer at AvoPie Start-up Company based in Berlin.\n\nFIRST OF ALL: it's not a usual/typical job/art time help/experiement that most people try doing/\"startupping\" and fail doing.\n\nIT IS A BIG THING & SERIOUS WORK - it's an investment and a serious commitment of your time/talent/resources into something that has the potential to become the biggest thing in your life. Working with a team that would eventually become your family. Are you on same wavelength?\n\nKey points for the position of a developer:\n\nAvoPie - The 1st the 1st real estate crowd-buying company, which aims to disrupt multi-trillion(!) travel (mobility), real estate and hospitality industries.\n\nWith AvoPie people can invest from as little as $1000 and own a share of real estate, diversify their portfolio and invest in multiple promising properties in many countries and profit from high future returns.\nReal Estate is the most lucrative investment niche and arguably the biggest asset class in the world.\nAre you tired of hearing of how successful are thousands of startups and raising millions/billions?\nTake your chance - let's embody our dreams into reality together.\n\nWe are Tech for Real Estate as well as Fin Tech - one of the biggest industries worldwide that still have so much space/potential for better/faster/smarter solutions and brilliant minds! Are you excited about it? Our product-service touches something that truely matters (to mention the least: people all over the world spend more than 75% of their lives in buildings).\n\nCURRENT STAGE: \nA. rich experience in startup and lean startup building\nB. incubator and accelerator experience\nC. international collaborations with various partners\nD. prototype building to be started asap\nE. based in Berlin Prenzlauer Berg\nF. applying to take part at the Berlin Accelerator Program and get a Stipendium / Funding\n\nThe requirements for you as a successful candidate:\n\n1. As it's a co-founder type of position (not to confuse with a \"Job\"), therefore you need to be able to bootstrap with us till we raise a round of investment that we expect in the next months as we are actively applying (are qualified) for selected accelerator programs / grants across Europe. \nThe salary will be paid from our own income generated from Sales, \nGrants / Investment we get from the programs/funds.\n\n2. Ideally you are an experienced (precious startup experience) full stack developer  (if not full stack: or one that could learn fast) to help AVO to take over and lead the project as a tech co-founder, to maintain and expand our current website and new features, find the most viable solutions for the needs of the company, actively growth-hack to leverage our reach and conversions, expand viral user engagement, eventually take the platform onto a new level/language when the investment occurs.\n\n3. Ideally you are an EU/EEA citizen, and based in Western Europe so that we can easily involve you on board as a shareholder and you will not have any obstacles in travel or employment throughout the EU/EEA space. If you are not such but can co-work on basis of up to 3 month visits - you will be travelling on weekly/monthly basis to Berlin, expense will be covered by AVO.\n\n4. If you are not based in Berlin/Germany - you/us should be PHYSICALLY co-working together from our home office in Berlin or your city at least 2-3 weeks a month (more often would be a huge plus). This means either first travel and stay/work with us on half month here/ half month there basis, and then once we become a tighter team - relocating to Berlin.\n\nFrom experience: co-founding is a committed collaboration not just an experiment. \nhardly possible or not ideal:\na) While having a FULL time job \nb) Family / Married and having Kids \n- most likely such person won't deliver the amount of hours and focus needed\n- is not optimal to give maximum chance for your startup to realise its entire potential and see if it can replace your previous occupations, and significantly change your life as YOUR MAIN BUSINESS. \nIf you are a self-employed/freelancing professional or PART TIME / Flexible HOURS employee who can control your schedule by having own projects / sources of income you have av REAL potential to build your own start-up business. \n\n5. We are actively applying and ready to join a strong accelerator program and graduate it with success (raise more funds) and take our enterprise to the next and more complex / more challenging and intriguing levels. \nThat means the accelerator program could take place in a West European city in the months to come (ex: DE, UK, FR, CH, NL, ES etc.) \nwhere the core founders would be physically present (typical program lasts around 3 months) with full focus on AVO with no distraction on other projects/jobs etc.- the program offers investment/will be paid. In case of further significant rounds of investment you should be able to come and work on AVO board full time for a salary & equity.\n\n6. You are a motivated and driven individual with entrepreneurial aspirations and readiness to \"walk an extra mile\", full respect towards your work partners, accountability, full reliability, have enough free time & independence.\n\nContact us: skype (djdamyan29) or ian@avotravel.com \nor SMS/Whatsapp at +4917636127937\nThanks a lot. \nIan and Stefan",
