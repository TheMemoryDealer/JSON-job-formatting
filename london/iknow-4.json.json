  "description": "Intermediary system in charge of entertaining the two conversationalists through nice questions with the aim of stipulating a real meeting in a partner activity (restaurants, cinema, market) in short, all the activities that have economic ends and are places of entertainment.\nWell, the world needs it because the applications of meetings and the current knowledge are qualitatively scarce, they cannot establish a meeting between two conversationalists, and this does not say simply my personal experience, but also market research.\nIknow, with questions such as: \"send your socks\" makes the conversation of the two conversationalists much more exciting, which makes the final meeting more likely.",
