  "description": "Nomad Academy brings driven individuals together to create entrepreneurial careers, in inspiring locations around the world.\n\nWe do it by combining travel, a select community and entrepreneurial learning (through workshops, coaching & online courses).\n\nWHY?\nSo many of us work in conventional careers that don’t give us meaning and hold us back from achieving all that we could. We do it because everyone else does, because it’s the safer route, because “that’s the way life is”.\n\nMost people settle for that. But a few don’t.\n\nNomad Academy was founded to bring together those few brave enough to pursue a meaningful life and become all that they could be – despite the risks and hardships involved.",
