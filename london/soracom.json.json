  "description": "Even for cloud-fluent developers, building for IoT can present a new kind of challenge. The Soracom platform is designed to make getting started easy and to scale as you do, with more advanced services available once you’re connected. From basic connectivity to advanced cloud integration, our philosophy carries across every service we offer: make it easy and keep the developer in control. Every service is offered on a pay-as-you-go, take-what-you-need basis. Pricing is completely transparent, there’s never any contract to sign, and you can stop the service the moment you stop needing it, or someone does it better than us. Get a SIM from us or from Amazon.com and get started.",
