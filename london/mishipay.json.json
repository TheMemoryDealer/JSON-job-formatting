  "description": "MishiPay's technology allows in-store shoppers to pick up a product, scan the barcode with their phone, pay with their phone and simply walk out with it or choose home delivery. It provides a fully theft-proof scan, pay and leave solution that completely eliminates queuing in retail and bridges online and offline into an Omni-channel experience.  \n\nAfter our highly successful first stage trials at The Dandy Lab in Spitalfields Market, London (http://thedandylab.com/) and go-live on the app store (https://appsto.re/gb/a2DE_.i). On the back of this, we have got a partnership with Cisco who have championed and sponsored us into IDEALondon (http://www.idea-london.co.uk/).\n\nWe are now working towards Proof of Concepts with some of the biggest retailers around the world and are thus looking to raise our seed round, expand our team and go to the next stage of development.",
