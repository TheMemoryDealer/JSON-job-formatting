  "description": "Intrro helps companies uncover, engage and source the best talent from their employees' networks, resulting in lower costs of hiring (no agency fees), a quicker process and better longevity with hires (as they are all referrals). \n \nThe way we do this is by connecting your employees' social networks (LinkedIn, FB, Github, Dribble, Gmail, etc) and using our bespoke algorithms we match their connections with your new job openings; you can then request your employee to make the introduction to the candidate and check whether they are interested in exploring opportunities at your company. \n\nHiring can cripple a business in terms of both time and money; all of the data suggests that hiring through referrals provides not only the cheapest avenue to hire but the highest in quality too. Intrro allows a company to do that seamlessly in a very affordable way, across all business lines. \n",
