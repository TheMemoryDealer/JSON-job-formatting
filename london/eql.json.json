  "description": "Phio is a stand alone digital physiotherapy service comprising of two parts:\n\nPhio Triage enables instant access to one of 3 care pathways. 1) urgent care for those presenting with serious “red flag” symptoms. 2) digital injury management (i.e. home exercise and rehabilitation) for those presenting with appropriate injuries (these tend to be  low grade soft tissue injuries). 3) face to face care for those not suited for self managed care. Within the NHS these escalation points may differ from area to area however the agile nature of the Phio Triage system means we can bespoke these pathways as needed, including PREMs and PROMs as required.\n\nPhio Digital Injury Management provides bespoke home exercise plans and self treatment techniques to those appropriate for self management. Tracking every interaction with the patient and collecting data regarding the progress of their rehab journey. Using engagement tools and AI to learn from those engagements Phio to ultimately improve outcomes.",
