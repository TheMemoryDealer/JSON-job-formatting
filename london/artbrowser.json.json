  "description": "Art is a pleasure. \n\nA pleasure that should be \"open to all\".\n\nNo pretension, no patronisation, no barriers. Part of your world not a special world.\n\nAt home, on the train, at work, in the street not just behind museum and gallery walls.\n\nSomething that talks to you, to your mood, to the moment. Something that feeds your soul.\n\nWhich is why we are more than just another place to buy art. We are a place for you to browse the universe of art.\n\nCreate your profile with art you love. Share it. Talk about it with fellow art lovers. Find what they love.\n\nConnect with the artists and galleries you are interested in.\n\nFollow the latest exhibitions, hot topics, talented artists and inspiring pieces from collectors.\n\nReceive suggestions from people like you - the real experts.\n\nAnd if you do want to buy as a result, we offer a 0% commission model for artists, galleries and buyers...so another barrier removed!\n\nThere is a universe of art waiting to be discovered. Browse with us.",
