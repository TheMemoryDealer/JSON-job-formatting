  "slogan": "An intelligent, learning healthcare system that rewards users for making healthier choices",
  "description": "It's comprehensive app-based healthcare, with user lifestyle tracking, nudging, health scores, redeemable health points, virtual clinics and pay-as-you-live cover for private hospital care. It is a direct competitor to insurers but is not insurance, so it will not be regulated by the FCA, will be sold direct online rather than through intermediaries and will be exempt from the insurance premium tax, which is currently 12%.",
