  "description": "Hatchpad’s mission is to connect rental communities.\n\nWe unify the rental experience for tenants and letting agents from search all the way through to contract signature and moving in. \n\nOur secure cloud-based platform handles the viewings and automates the whole administrative process from start to finish; re-shaping the rental experience for both the tenant as well as the agent.\n\nHatchpad gives letting agents more time to focus on bringing on new landlords without having to spend so much time on the viewings and administration. We are revolutionising the whole rental experience for the tenant(s) whilst they search and sign for their new property.",
