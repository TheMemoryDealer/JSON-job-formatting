  "description": "Hotelflex is shaking up the way the hotel industry manages inventory. We don't believe in the prehistoric 3pm check-in and 11am check-out, surely you (the guest) can choose when you want to arrive and depart and then pay accordingly, right? We agree, which is why we're building a product that lets you do just that!\n\nWhilst this concept makes total sense for the guest, it's also incredibly attractive for hotels as it's incremental revenue, in other words, pure bottom-line profit. A typical 300-400 bed hotel using Hotelflex can generate an additional $2,500 - $18,000 per month, which, as profit margin goes, is huge! This number varies so much because there are so many factors at play, such as the pricing structure, available inventory, and guest messaging, all of which can be optimised.",
