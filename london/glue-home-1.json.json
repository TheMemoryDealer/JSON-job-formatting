  "description": "At Glue, we're passionate about inventing the future of convenience. Whether it's letting you know your kids are home from school, lending virtual keys to a friend, or providing temporary access to cleaners or in-home deliveries, we want to make the user experience as smooth and secure as possible. Imagine - coming home to your grocery order already in the fridge, dry cleaning returned and your online shopping packages waiting in the hall. We think that's pretty exciting, and we're looking for individuals who are interested in the future possibilities of Glue, and the prospect of joining our team to create and evolve fantastic, game-changing products.",
