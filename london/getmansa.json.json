  "description": "A new era begins with the creation of the Borrowing as a Service (BaaS) by Mansa. We believe that it's time to set the record straight by allowing freelancers and gig workers borrow money with fair pricing and a genuine user experience.  \n\nMansa was founded by millennials who believe that the traditional economy is shifting towards the freelance and gig world.  By being extremely focused on product, coding and data, Mansa Team wants to build a strong tech culture and fix freelancers personal finance once for all.\n\nWe are choosing to build a quality team vs a large team. You will be a formative part of our company culture moving forward. To that point, we want someone that can take ownership of a project from beginning to end.\n\nWe have recently closed a ¬£2M seed round with Founders Future (Investor in Pinterest, Lendix, YUKA) and several great angel investors who have built and sold industry leading companies.",
