We’ve grown from a six-person start-up in London to become one of the fastest growing consumer businesses to originate from Europe.\n\nWe are obsessed with design and technology and on a mission to be the world’s best platform to discover and buy tickets to amazing live experiences. The best artists all work closely with us to make sure their tickets go to their fans, not scalpers or touts.\n\nWHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR\n\nWe’re looking for Backend Engineers with strong technical skills and potential. You’re a team player who can collaborate with people in various roles and levels of technical ability, and understand the delicate balance between moving fast & iteration against building tested, resilient code.\n\nYou may not have much experience with Elixir, but you are excited by learning new technology and have a desire to grow in this area, then this the opportunity you've been waiting for!\n\nOUR TECHNOLOGY\n\nOur backend apps are written mostly in Elixir and Go. They feed various information to our award-winning apps with GraphQL and REST API and handle millions of transactions for our ticket sales in a reliable manner.\n\nOur code is hosted in GitHub which we use for creating pull requests and carrying out code reviews. Our pipelines are managed by Travis CI and each commit will build a Docker container. We spin up short term Kubernetes clusters with the new feature branch of the app you are working on and all the other various services so that our QA team can test your new feature in the entire stack. Once passed code gets merged and pushed to the production cluster.\n\nWe are always open to making changes and improvements to our workflow and code base for the benefit of the team and product.\n\nHOW WE WORK\n\nAs a Backend Engineer at DICE, you’ll work in cross-functional, collaborative teams alongside Mobile App Engineers, Frontend Engineers, Product Managers, Product Designers, User Researchers, DevOps, QA Testers and Growth Managers. You’ll also be working on projects with people outside on the Product team, including Creative, Fan Support, Accounts & Venues. You will also get chances to head down to tackle some interesting technical problems such as scalability, reliability, security and internal tools.\n\nAs we grow, we’re planning to transition into squads and disciplines, while keeping the teams flat. Each squad will have a dedicated goal and each discipline will keep horizontal relationships.\n\nYou and your team will be responsible for an overall company goal, rather than building a specific feature - you'll have a direct impact on both what we build, and how we build it.\n\nAs a Product team, we meet every two weeks to discuss hurdles we’re facing across the company and work together to overcome these. As a discipline regularly to discuss tools and techniques to update out codebase and improve processes, as well as put our heads together about best approaches when faced with a new technical challenge.\n\nKey Responsibilities:\n\nDevelop our backend system written in Elixir\nWork cross-functional with Product Managers, Testers, Engineers and Designers to understand requirements, provide technical insights and provide timescale estimations\nWork in an iterative approach, designing, building and trialling out new concepts quickly to test assumptions and create the best possible service we can\nContribute to the improvement of our internal tools and make their/your life easier\nCare about maintainability of the software. Write clean code as well as unit tests and documentation\n\nRequirements:\n\nExperienced with a web application framework e.g. Phoenix, RoR, Django etc.\nA genuine interest in Elixir\nExperience designing and developing systems at scale\nExperience implementing clean and efficient solutions\nExperience delivering business valuable features quickly\nStrong understanding of how databases work internally\nStrong understanding of how computer networks work\nUnderstanding of how OSes and Linux work internally\nExperience integrating 3rd party services\nBENEFITS\n\nCompetitive salary\nUnlimited paid holiday!\nMonthly DICE credit to spend on your favourite gigs!\nPrivate healthcare, provided by Vitality\nMental health and wellbeing programme with free coaching and CBT\nFree breakfast every day\nChildcare scheme, provided by TEDSgroup\nRegular socials, Summer Fridays and company teams and clubs",
