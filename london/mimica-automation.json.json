  "slogan": "Delegating the world's repetitive work to AI",
  "description": "100 billion. That’s the number of hours of repetitive, manual work we will do on our computers this year. Businesses would kill to automate this work, but state-of-the-art software automation requires teams of developers, months of effort, and hundreds of thousands of pounds to deploy. Most businesses simply can’t afford that price tag. \n\nAt Mimica we are developing a new paradigm for automation: our software learns to automate work just by observing it. This eliminates the need for developers, making the benefits of automation accessible to everyone.\n\nOur algorithms learn by watching you work, observing clicks and keystrokes and using machine learning to identify repetition within this dataset. This approach dramatically broadens automation potential within a business. With Mimica, all of the low-volume, bespoke tasks that never warranted attention suddenly become viable candidates for automation, opening up a $5T previously untapped market.",
