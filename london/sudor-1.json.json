  "description": "In the same way Uber enables anyone to become a taxi driver, and Airbnb enables anyone to become a hotelier, Sudor enables anyone to become the next big fitness influencer. Subscribers can either subscribe to one specific trainer or all the trainers on the platform. The trainers have choreographed workouts in which they demonstrate each exercise as well as explain the exercise, just as a personal trainer would. The trainer will essentially be doing the workout with the client.",
