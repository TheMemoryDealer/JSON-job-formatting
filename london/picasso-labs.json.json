  "description": "As imagery and video dominate the way brands communicate with consumers, marketers have no data to understand which visual properties resonate and, more importantly, why. Picasso Labs is bringing creative into the data age by providing an AI solution that measures how consumers' real-time response to imagery changes based on the unique visual properties of each creative, anywhere. \n\nIn 5 years, we believe that every successful creative decision will be powered by Picasso Labs data.  Since our founding 18 months ago, Picasso has been selected as one of Unilever's most innovative marketing companies of 2016 and helps brands like Unilever, Warner Music, Volvo, Farfetch, and Samsung understand the visual preferences of their audience, reduce creative guesswork, and improve marketing performance. Backed by Harrison Metal, Index Ventures, and other fantastic investors, we're a team of 9 & currently on the lookout for others to join us on our quest for world domination. \n",

We're backed by Harrison Metal, Index Ventures, and Saatchi & Saatchi. We're also lucky to count senior execs at AirBnB, Twitter, and Google as our investors and advisors. Our existing team has worked at Google, Yahoo, GE, & Accenture, and holds degrees from Columbia, Cornell, Princeton, Cambridge, and UPenn, among others. \n\nWho We Are: \nAs imagery and video increasingly dominate the way we communicate, brands have limited data to understand which visual properties resonate with their users and, more importantly, why. Picasso Labs is bringing creativity into the data age by providing an AI solution that measures how consumers' real-time response to imagery and video changes based on the unique visual properties of each creative, across all the social, paid, and owned platforms that matter. \n\nPicasso was recently selected as one of Unilever's most innovative marketing companies of 2016, 2017, and 2018 and helps brands like Unilever, Louis Vuitton, Four Seasons, Tesco, and Google understand the visual preferences of their audience, reduce creative guesswork, and improve marketing performance. Using our data, our clients have changed the album cover for a #1 Top Billboard 100 artist, expanded into new markets, launched new products, and optimized lots of creatives, all with confidence knowing that their creative decisions are backed by hard facts. And we’ve saved them hours of times and oodles of guesswork by providing analytics that demystify the performance of any creative, anywhere. \n\nWhat we look for: \nWe value engineers who love data and appreciate the quantitative side of life (a background in math, physics, statistics, or economics is music to our ears). People who look for an agile environment and love to work on an autonomous but closely-knit team would thrive here. Also, it's important to us that the person who joins wants to contribute to growing the company overall, and while your main job will be programming, we prefer to work with people who speak up and make their voice heard when it comes to other aspects of our product, including design, UX, and feature development. \n\nOur ideal new teammate is someone who likes to learn new things and stretch themselves. We know lots of places say that, so what do we mean? If you think that a new piece of tech that you've been experimenting with on the weekends would help us work better, encourage us to test it out.
