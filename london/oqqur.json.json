  "slogan": "An app for guides to broadcast their tours live, in 360 degrees",
  "description": "oQQur is a web, and mobile app for real-time video tours. Guides broadcast, monetize, take questions and requests from their virtual group.\n\nThe service is built around streaming from 360 cameras, though tour guides will be able to use traditional video as well. Users can chat with each other and the guide. The app allows tipping and we will implement paid events as well.\n\nThere are potentially different content creator personas to pursue such as tabletop games, video blogger private streams, podcast creators, and disaster surveys.",
