  "description": "We believe the availability of great data-sets determines the potential impact machine learning can have on the world. So we’re building tools that make capturing well structured data more accessible to all.\n\nEmpowering the creator to make a beautiful piece of generative art, helping the early-stage start up build a robust ML model for elderly fall detection, and enabling large engineering teams to crowdsource a data set of street signs in Germany. We are shortening the gap between an idea and an intelligent experience or creation. Let’s help creators, technologists, and businesses of all sizes not be held back by the lack of well structured data. ",
