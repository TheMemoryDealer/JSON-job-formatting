This is a huge transformation in customer experience and opens up vast opportunities for transport providers.\n\nAs we progress, the Dazzle platform will enable deep insight into the preferences, context and needs of every individual end-user of our services. It will then compare, collate, analyse and learn in order to orchestrate and personalise every conversation, taking the pain out of travel decisions and delivering value-add products and services.\n\nHow we do things\n\nWe work in cross-functional product teams with bi-weekly sprints. \nYou can expect to work on a wide variety of technical solutions from user-facing applications to internal tools. \nWe take pride in the code we ship and aim to do all the right things (test driven development, code reviews, “leave it better than you found it”, etc) and expect you to contribute to the improvement of these development processes.\nWe have the whole company in one office to make sure we operate as a close-knit team. This means that everyone learns together and delivers together and it means that everyone can be close to, and contribute to, the pulse of the business.\n \nSome of the technologies we use: \nWe currently use Java (Netty, DL4J, Elasticsearch) to write our application code, Ansible to deploy and Javascript (MaterialUI, React.js, Redux.js, ES6, Webpack) on the frontend. Some of the services we use are Dialogflow, Amazon Alexa, Contentful, CloudFormation, Twilio. \n\nThe Role: \nYou will be joining a small, focused team working on our core server application.

If everyone wants to go further this will be followed by some simple coding challenges. If that goes well, there will be a final interview with the engineers and product managers you’ll be working with. \nYour interview will be centred around a pair programming exercise and we’ll also look for evidence of strong communication and team skills. We promise no brain teasers! Throughout the process you’ll meet a number of people including engineering leaders, fellow individual contributors and product managers.
