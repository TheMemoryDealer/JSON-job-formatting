      "description": "Hey 👋\n\nSince we launched over 3 years ago, we’ve been on a mission 👊 A mission to make everyone (starting with our awesome Plumsters), financially better off!\n\nWe do this by helping automate their savings, avoid overpaying on bills, and providing a simple platform to invest, if they’d like to try and grow their money for the future 🌱\n\nPlum is a quirky and fun AI assistant that started life as a Messenger chatbot (now also available as an app for Android and iOS). By linking directly to our users’ bank accounts, we are able to analyse transaction data to learn about their income and spending.\n\nWe use this to make sure savings still happen even when they’re not thinking about it, because we believe this helps them save… MORE! We can also scan tariffs to advise when we think they’re paying too much on bills e.g. household utilities 🔌\n\nPlum is also a business, and every business ultimately needs to make money. But the social aspect of what we do is also really important to us. We’re trying to change things for the better, by helping our users fight against a confusing financial system that is stacked against the most vulnerable in society (such as those on low income or the elderly).\n\nSpecifically, here’s what we’re trying to tackle:\n\n- 90% of UK savings accounts pay less than inflation\n- £4bn lost to the loyalty penalty every year\n- ⅔ of UK adults say money stress has affected the health or wellbeing of someone they know\n\nSince the beginning of 2017, we've grown from 2 founders sharing a rusty desk in Soho, to a brilliant, hard-working team of 40, and raised $10.5 million in total.\n\nNow, with more than 850,000 people already using Plum, we could use a little help with our mission… and that may be where you come in!\n\nWe’re looking for a talented Backend Engineer to join our Athens team.\n\n**Engineering at Plum**\n\nOur engineers come from a variety of backgrounds (physics, computer science, music, even history!) and we welcome all levels of experience. We value good engineering principles and healthy curiosity. We take a conservative approach to using external frameworks and we aspire to write simple, well-tested code, delivered in rapid iterations.\n\nWe currently operate a Python monolith on a 80+ pod Kubernetes cluster on Google Cloud Platform and wrangle ~1TB of data in Postgres and BigQuery. You'll get to work on bank data ingestion, payments, investments, data pipelines, user-facing features and our in-house chat framework (think NLP). On top, you'll play an integral role in taking Plum's infrastructure to an exciting next level – a suite of fault-tolerant, self-contained backend services. It's a really good chance to get your hands dirty with a product that is already used by 850,000 people in the UK.\n\n**How we work**\n\nWe work in \"[squads](https://labs.spotify.com/2014/03/27/spotify-engineering-culture-part-1/)\" – a more startup-appropriate name for saying small, cross-functional teams. Each squad has a mission and a set of KPIs to monitor and improve. We have 3 of these squads right now – Savings, Investments and Black Ops. As an engineer you'll work in a squad but you can also reach out to and work with anyone in the company.\n\nOur culture: openness and accountability\n\nEven though you'll have a primary role, you can get involved in any aspect of the business you're interested in and contribute feedback and product ideas freely. In return, we'll expect you to back your decisions with data and logic. Features are considered finished when the data tells us that they've moved the needle.\n\n**What we look for**\n\nTechnical knowledge is critical but we are a startup treading in uncharted territory so attitude is even more important. We're looking for people that like uncertainty and want to figure out how to do things that haven’t been done before. You're a true team player and inherently positive. Where others see problems, you see solutions.\n\n**What we offer**\n\n- Join one of the hottest fintech start-up in London 🇬🇧\n- One of the best learning experiences of your life. You'll get to work with extremely smart and capable people, with backgrounds in finance, physics, history, computing, languages and more.\n- We're all in this together! Own part of the company through stock options 💷\n- Our annual team trip, to a secret destination ✈️\n- We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity\n- Flexibility to work from our London office (almost) whenever you want\n- 22 days holiday a year, excluding bank holidays (35 in total)\n- An office brimming with fruit & snacks, coffee, plants, and a vibe that’s... 🦄🌈💯\n\nIf you think this sounds like a bit of you then don’t hesitate to get in touch!\n\nThanks,\n\nPlum’s tame humans 💜\n\n",

By linking directly to our users’ bank accounts, we are able to analyse transaction data to learn about their income and spending.\n\nWe use this to make sure savings still happen even when they’re not thinking about it, because we believe this helps them save… MORE! We can also scan tariffs to advise when we think they’re paying too much on bills e.g. household utilities 🔌\n\nPlum is also a business, and every business ultimately needs to make money. But the social aspect of what we do is also really important to us. We’re trying to change things for the better, by helping our users fight against a confusing financial system that is stacked against the most vulnerable in society (such as those on low income or the elderly).\n\nSpecifically, here’s what we’re trying to tackle:\n\n- 90% of UK savings accounts pay less than inflation\n- £4bn lost to the loyalty penalty every year\n- ⅔ of UK adults say money stress has affected the health or wellbeing of someone they know\n\nSince the beginning of 2017, we've grown from 2 founders sharing a rusty desk in Soho, to a brilliant, hard-working team of 40, and raised $10.5 million in total.\n\nNow, with more than 850,000 people already using Plum, we could use a little help with our mission… and that may be where you come in!\n\nWe’re looking for a talented Technical Product Manager to join our London team.

You'll need to be able to communicate with stakeholders (tech, compliance, support etc) effectively and transmit efficient communication to the whole team.\n\n**Ideally you will:**\n\n### \n\n- A person who is very familiar with tech.

By linking directly to our users’ bank accounts, we are able to analyse transaction data to learn about their income and spending.</p>\n\n<p>We use this to make sure savings still happen even when they’re not thinking about it, because we believe this helps them save… MORE! We can also scan tariffs to advise when we think they’re paying too much on bills e.g. household utilities 🔌</p>\n\n<p>Plum is also a business, and every business ultimately needs to make money.

On top, you'll play an integral role in taking Plum's infrastructure to an exciting next level – a suite of fault-tolerant, self-contained backend services.

We’re trying to change things for the better, by helping our users fight against a confusing financial system that is stacked against the most vulnerable in society (such as those on low income or the elderly) 💜</p>\n\n<p>Specifically, here’s what we’re trying to tackle:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>11.5m people in the UK have less than £100 in savings</li>\n<li>90% of UK savings accounts pay less than inflation</li>\n<li>£4bn lost to the loyalty penalty every year</li>\n<li>2/3 of UK adults say money stress has affected the health or wellbeing of someone they know.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In three years, we&#39;ve grown from 2 co-founders sharing a rusty desk in Soho, to a brilliant, hard-working team of 40, with offices in London and Athens.</p>\n\n<p>Now, with more than 900,000 people already using Plum, we could use a little help with our mission and that might be where you come in!</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Team</strong></p>\n\n<p>We’re looking for a talented Wealth Product Manager to join our Product Team in London.

This is a core component of our investment product strategy, so you need to have adequate experience, or have been working at a slightly more junior level, with an ambition to now take a step up.</p>\n\n<p>The development and launch of our trading product is going to be one of your concerns.</p>\n\n<p>You&#39;ll be managing a team of talented engineers 👩‍🔧and you will need to guide them to deliver quality product features on time. You&#39;ll need to make sure you are looking at the right data and define the KPIs and analytics requirements and ensure appropriate tracking is in place to measure and drive engagement.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ideally You Will:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Be responsible for helping shape the creation of future trading and wealth products.</li>\n<li>Finding the best solution for our trading and wealth products, including negotiating and securing deals with partners.</li>\n<li>Conduct market and competitor research to ensure Plum has a market leading product.</li>\n<li>Lead a team of talented product-minded engineers to achieve a common growth goal.</li>\n<li>Get involved with bucketfuls of challenging problems to solve, so hopefully that&#39;s your thing!<br></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>You Are:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>A person who likes looking at the correct data and understands data.</li>\n<li>Moving the needle in key company metrics excites you, motivates you and does not scare you.</li>\n<li>Able to manage a team of engineers.</li>\n<li>Able to transmit your enthusiasm to your team and make sure you are all working effectively towards your goal.</li>\n<li>Excited to work in a startup already disrupting the financial industry and see it grow.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Plum&#39;s Perks</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Join one of the hottest fintech start-up in London 🇬🇧</li>\n<li>We&#39;re all in this together! Own part of the company through stock options 💷</li>\n<li>Flexibility to work from our Athens office (almost) whenever you want 🇬🇷</li>\n<li>25 days holiday a year, excluding bank holidays (33 in total)</li>\n<li>Our annual team trip, to a secret destination ✈️</li>\n<li>An office brimming with fruit &amp; snacks, coffee, plants, and a vibe that’s... 🦄🌈💯<br></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you think this sounds like a bit of you, then don’t hesitate to get in touch!</p>\n\n<p>Thanks,</p>\n\n<p>Plum’s tame humans 💜</p>\n\n<p><strong>Requirements</strong></p>\n",

We're building a quirky intelligent system that links to your bank, understands your spending habits and helps you save more, invest in things that matter and avoid overspending on your bills. We like to think of Plum as your money's best friend 👫\n\n**Plum on iOS**\n\nWe’re looking for a customer-focussed iOS engineer to join our engineering team. Plum is already used by 650.000+ people in the UK, has been featured multiple times by Apple and currently rated 4.67 stars with 8,000 ratings. You'll be building Plum on iOS from its early days, giving our current and prospective customers a more intimate way to interact with their money.\n\n**Our engineering approach**\n\nWe value good engineering principles, imagination, quirkiness and healthy curiosity. We take a conservative approach to using external frameworks and we aspire to write simple, well-tested code, delivered in rapid iterations.\n\n**How we work**\n\nWe work in \"[squads](https://workable.com/nr?l=https%3A%2F%2Flabs.spotify.com%2F2014%2F03%2F27%2Fspotify-engineering-culture-part-1%2F)\" – a more startup-appropriate name for saying small, cross-functional teams. Each squad has a mission and a set of KPIs to monitor and improve. We have 3 of these squads right now – Savings, Investments and Black Ops. As an engineer you'll work in a squad but you can also reach out to and work with anyone in the company.\n\n**Our culture: openness and accountability**\n\nEven though you'll have a primary role, you can get involved in any aspect of the business you're interested in and contribute feedback and product ideas freely. In return, we'll expect you to back your decisions with data and logic. Features are considered finished when the data tells us that they've moved the needle.\n\n**Requirements**\n\nTechnical knowledge is critical but we are a startup treading in uncharted territory so attitude is even more important. We're looking for people that like uncertainty and want to figure out how to do things that haven’t been done before. You're a true team player and inherently positive. Where others see problems, you see solutions.\n\n**About you**\n\n- You want to build a product that makes people better off\n- You’re excited about programming in Swift and up-to-date with the latest iOS technologies\n- Yet, you still have intimate knowledge of the full iOS stack\n- You have experience shipping and iterating on an app in the App Store\n- You’re a designers best friend. You love being part of the design process and enjoy turning the design into a well crafted, delightful experience\n- You’re a product person too — you understand the value and impact of your work\n- You go the extra mile to add the awesome sprinkles\n- Remote experience (if applying for a remote role)\n- Work within 2+/- hours of UK time (if applying for a remote role)\n\n**Bonus fist-bumps 👊 if you have**\n\n- Have experience in continuous integration setup and automation\n- Taken part in open source projects\n- Experience with backend technologies\n\n**Benefits**\n\n- Competitive salary\n- Chance to work at one of the hottest fintech startup in London\n- Bucketfuls of challenging problems to solve, so hopefully that's your thing!
