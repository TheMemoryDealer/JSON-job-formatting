By linking directly to our users‚Äô bank accounts, we are able to analyse transaction data to learn about their income and spending.\n\nWe use this to make sure savings still happen even when they‚Äôre not thinking about it, because we believe this helps them save‚Ä¶ MORE! We can also scan tariffs to advise when we think they‚Äôre paying too much on bills e.g. household utilities üîå\n\nPlum is also a business, and every business ultimately needs to make money. But the social aspect of what we do is also really important to us. We‚Äôre trying to change things for the better, by helping our users fight against a confusing financial system that is stacked against the most vulnerable in society (such as those on low income or the elderly).\n\nSpecifically, here‚Äôs what we‚Äôre trying to tackle:\n\n- 90% of UK savings accounts pay less than inflation\n- ¬£4bn lost to the loyalty penalty every year\n- ‚Öî of UK adults say money stress has affected the health or wellbeing of someone they know\n\nSince the beginning of 2017, we've grown from 2 founders sharing a rusty desk in Soho, to a brilliant, hard-working team of 40, and raised $10.5 million in total.\n\nNow, with more than 850,000 people already using Plum, we could use a little help with our mission‚Ä¶ and that may be where you come in!\n\nWe‚Äôre looking for a talented Backend Engineer to join our Athens team.\n\n**Engineering at Plum**\n\nOur engineers come from a variety of backgrounds (physics, computer science, music, even history!) and we welcome all levels of experience. We value good engineering principles and healthy curiosity. We take a conservative approach to using external frameworks and we aspire to write simple, well-tested code, delivered in rapid iterations.\n\nWe currently operate a Python monolith on a 80+ pod Kubernetes cluster on Google Cloud Platform and wrangle ~1TB of data in Postgres and BigQuery. You'll get to work on bank data ingestion, payments, investments, data pipelines, user-facing features and our in-house chat framework (think NLP). On top, you'll play an integral role in taking Plum's infrastructure to an exciting next level ‚Äì a suite of fault-tolerant, self-contained backend services. It's a really good chance to get your hands dirty with a product that is already used by 850,000 people in the UK.\n\n**How we work**\n\nWe work in \"[squads](https://labs.spotify.com/2014/03/27/spotify-engineering-culture-part-1/)\" ‚Äì a more startup-appropriate name for saying small, cross-functional teams. Each squad has a mission and a set of KPIs to monitor and improve. We have 3 of these squads right now ‚Äì Savings, Investments and Black Ops. As an engineer you'll work in a squad but you can also reach out to and work with anyone in the company.\n\nOur culture: openness and accountability\n\nEven though you'll have a primary role, you can get involved in any aspect of the business you're interested in and contribute feedback and product ideas freely. In return, we'll expect you to back your decisions with data and logic. Features are considered finished when the data tells us that they've moved the needle.\n\n**What we look for**\n\nTechnical knowledge is critical but we are a startup treading in uncharted territory so attitude is even more important.
