How important is to you where do you spend most of your life?\n\nTasks:\nSales, Expansion of Business and Attraction of Customers both B2B and B2C, Concierge Service type of Sales (Lean Startup) . Inventory / Real Estate for Rent / Acquisition / growth hacking. Setting more and more ambitious goals, growing nationally and internationally. In perspective: globally.\n\nWhat do we offer?\n\nTwo Main preferred ways of collaboration: \n1. Co-Founder for Equity and full hands-on involvement\nor \n2. Partner with generous commissions from successful sales earnings/income.\n\nOUR CURRENT STAGE: \nA. we are employing a full time marketing intern who helps serve the booking inquiries (concierge service) \nB. we have clients and are acquiring corporate clients \nC. are generating turnover (have proven the biz model), have traction \nD. are 4 board members \n\nThe requirements for you as a successful candidate:\n\n1. As it's a co-founder type of position, therefore you need to be able to bootstrap with us till we raise a round of investment that we expect in the months to come as we are actively applying (are qualified) for selected accelerator programs / grants across Europe. The salary will be paid from the Grants / Investment we get from the programs/funds.\n\n2. Ideally you are an experienced sales person, with experience in Real Estate operations and Sales. You should have a record of sales (all sorts of sales that are knows in RE) that you have generated mainly yourself without being employed by a company (not as employee) so that we are sure you are a strong and independent professional who can push sales and co-found a super-successful company with us that aims far and wide.\n\n3.

If you are based in Germany - you should be physically attending our home office in Berlin at least once a month (more often would be a huge plus) besides the regular tele-media contact that we will have. \nFrom experience we can say that co-founding while having a FULL time job is not optimal to give maximum chance for your startup to realize its entire potential and see if it can replace your previous occupations, and significantly change your life as YOUR MAIN BUSINESS - that's what we're all working \ntowards. If you are a self-employed/freelancing professional (like the core AVO team) or PART TIME / Flexible HOURS employee who can control your schedule by having own projects/sources of income you have the most potential to start your own start-up business.
