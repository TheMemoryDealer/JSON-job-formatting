  "slogan": "Machine Learning for your Memories",
  "description": "In an increasingly digital world, it's all too easy to lose your photos to the cloud or to the depths of your camera roll, never to be seen again.\n\nSo we decided to do something about it.\n\nPopsa launched in 2016 to bring your memories to life by printing them in beautiful, physical products that you can hold.\n\nHowever, instead of making you spend hours designing your product (like Snapfish or Photobox), we do the hard work for you in minutes.\n\nOur vision is to send you regular bundles of photos in the post without you having to think about it. Little presents to yourself. A monthly subscription to your memories.\n\nWe're developing technology to make it happen:\n\n• Machine learning to curate your most sentimental photos.\n• Bespoke algorithms to automatically design beautiful layouts.\n• The fastest delivery from the best printers in the world.\n\nCustomers will sign up and every month they'll unwrap a new collection of memories to keep for years to come.\n\nJoin us:\nhttps://blog.popsa.com/jobs",
