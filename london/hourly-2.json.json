Some of these engineers will be able to stay on and provide ad-hoc or full time support in the future but we are ideally looking for someone who can come in and command our entire tech stack, taking ownership over the product- enabling you to fix bugs, develop new features and improve the efficiency of our product.\n\nIn terms of the person we're looking for: \n\n- You could be a CompSci graduate from a top university.\n\n- You could be an experienced engineer who wants to join a startup at an early stage (But with less risk since we've built our first release/can pay a salary).\n\nAnd in all honesty, we don't mind if you have 20 years or 2 years experience. We care more about how much you're willing to put in to this as a Co-Founder and how much you're willing to learn. A growth mindset and passion for our business means more to us than having worked/interned at Google. \n\nIn return we will always conduct ethical business, building a great product that helps everyday people, businesses and the world around us.
