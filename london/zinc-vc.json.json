  "description": "Zinc builds new companies that tackle the biggest social problems in the developed world. \n\nWe  do this through a 9-month, full-time programme for 50 creative, entrepreneurial individuals who come together at Zinc to start a new business from scratch. They build scalable products and services that target millions of customers, based on the best social science research, exponential technologies and creative design.\n\nEach programme has a specific 'mission'; the first one focused on improving women's and girls' mental and emotional health, and the second, which is currently underway, focuses on unlocking opportunities for people in places that have been hard-hit by globalisation and automation.\n\nZinc’s third mission is to add five more years of high quality to later life. More details, including why we’ve chosen this mission and 10 key opportunity areas for new businesses, can be found: https://www.zinc.vc/mission-3",
