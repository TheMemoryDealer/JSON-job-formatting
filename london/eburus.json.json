  "description": "Eburus is a website that provides content, resources, and tools to help people take care of their parents and aging loved ones. This is a growing problem In 2012, one in seven Canadians was a senior and, as a whole, seniors accounted for nearly half of all public sector health care costs. By 2030, almost one in four Canadians will be a senior citizen. While this is not a sexy problem, it is a glaring one and we intend to solve it.  \n\nLearn more at Eburus.com or check out our facebook group at https://www.facebook.com/groups/careforelderly/",
