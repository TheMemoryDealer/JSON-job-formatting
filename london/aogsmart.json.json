  "slogan": "A digitised support & trading network for resolving commercial aircraft disruptions.",
  "description": "The product is a digitized support network with the capabilities for a component, logistics and tooling resource exchange via a smart trading platform. \n\nIt helps our customers to significantly reduce the downtime of their aircraft which only make money when they are flying. Its a colossal loss to an airline when their aircraft aren't making money and in a $90bn industry this level of efficiency delivers over 30% savings to their running costs.\n\nOur customers are all the airlines, OEMs, Maintenance, Overhaul and Repair organizations, part suppliers and brokers.",
