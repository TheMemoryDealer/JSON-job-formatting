  "description": "Real Kombucha is a light, tart, refreshingly carbonated, non-alcoholic brew made from exquisite fine teas from small tea gardens around the world. Brewed using fermentation techniques usually found in fine wines and the best craft beers, we have developed a brew that can compete with the best fermented beverages, but with less than 50 calories per bottle and only a remnant of alcohol.\n\nThe market for kombucha has topped $1b in the US, and is growing fast around the globe. But, typically, these companies are brewing a fairly basic, healthy alternative to a soft drink. At Real Kombucha, we have developed a product that uses a production method, and a flavour profile, that has more in common with a Prosecco or sparkling wine, and consequently addresses a massively wider market than the typically health focused kombuchas.",
