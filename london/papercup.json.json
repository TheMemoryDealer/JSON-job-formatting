Our ambition is to make the world's content watchable in any language. We're translating videos by generating voices that sound like the original speaker, not only capturing the characteristics of your voice but also the way you speak.\n\nWe are backed by LocalGlobe (investors in Zoopla, Transferwise, Improbable), Entrepreneur First (investors in Tractable, Magic Pony, Bloomsbury AI) and two of the largest media companies in the UK.",
