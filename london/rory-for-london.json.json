  "slogan": "Rory Stewart's independent political campaign for Mayor of London",
  "description": "Rory is standing for London Mayor to tackle the tough problems our city faces. He wants to make sure his children grow up in a city that’s still the world’s greatest. In recent months, he has gone out onto the streets, right across London, to hear people’s concerns and ideas for improving our city. Running as an independent, he’s free from party political games - able to work with everyone and take on good ideas no matter where they come from. He’s in no-one’s pocket - and answers only to ordinary Londoners.\n\nRory doesn’t accept our city’s problems are impossible to solve. As Mayor, he’ll roll up his sleeves and get things done - as he always has.",
