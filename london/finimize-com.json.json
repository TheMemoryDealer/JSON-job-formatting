Our ever-growing community now stands at nearly 300,000.\n\nWe've launched an iOS app that aims to get users more confident putting their money to work and growing their wealth. This app has been featured twice by Apple (once as App of the Day) and was in the Product Hunt top 3 Fintech apps of the 2018. We also produce a popular daily financial newsletter that explains the key stories of the day in 3 minutes without jargon.\n\nFinimize is written by our own experts who come from Goldman Sachs, Bloomberg and other top financial institutions; and we have talented technical, creative and entrepreneurial minds working on our products. We are also backed by Passion Capital as well as other top VCs. \n\nBefore Finimize, CEO Max Rofagha co-founded an e-commerce startup with 200 employees and sold it in 2015 – he was featured on the Forbes “30 under 30\" list as a result.",
