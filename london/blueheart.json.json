  "description": "Blueheart is inventing fully-automated digital sex therapy to help the hundreds of millions of people across the world that face sexual dysfunction. With a team whose Engineering wing comprises of 2 Cambridge graduates in Computer Science and Mathematics, the Business side managed by Sachin with a background in technology product management (UCL Dean's List & Cambridge) plus one of the world's foremost sex therapists, Dr Kat Hertlein, who wrote the seminal textbook for clinicians of sexual therapy, Blueheart's team is incredibly well placed to solve this issue.\n\nWe're transforming how humans connect with each other to live beautiful lives with the people they love. Most importantly, we don't want anyone to feel alone when facing sexual issues that often carry shame & embarrassment. \n\nWe're out there on the App & Play stores and have been revenue generating since Month 1. \n\nWe're on a crusade to make sex therapy affordable, accessible and embarrassment free by harnessing technology in an innovative way to change the world for the better. \n\nIf you connect with our message, please get in touch. We love to hear from anyone and everyone. Message us at hello@blueheart.io ",
