Our user-friendly tech platform simplifies and speeds up access to loans, grants and equity funding across Ireland and the UK. We integrate with multiple data sources to help our customers build their business profile quickly and be instantly matched to funding. Our customers also have their own financial dashboard to keep up to date on their financial and liquidity metrics and we alert them when they become eligible for new funds or savings. Once we match to the right funding or saving we manage the application process so that our customers can focus on building their business. Customers range from start-up business to larger corporates requiring capital.\n\nSwoop wants to take the pain out of raising finance and saving finance for business owners and financial advisors. Our SMEs are time poor, so we need to design systems and journeys that seem effortless and intuitive, so that they can spend more time managing their businesses.",
