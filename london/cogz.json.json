  "description": "COGZ is an online marketplace that connects farmers and growers with surplus and imperfect produce directly to food and beverage manufacturers saving them time and money whilst increasing crop yield and preventing food waste.\n\nCOGZ is a finalist of Pitch at Palace 11.0, part of the Allia Future 20 and is currently taking part in the EIT Food and Mass Challenge Accelerator.\n\nWorking with over 60 farmers and growers in the UK and across Europe and New Zealand COGZ is transforming the way fresh produce is bought and sold. The COGZ platform enables growers to find a buyer for their surplus produce reducing food waste in primary production and enabling manufacturers to create more sustainable products for the end consumer using rescues produce.\n\nCOGZ are looking to connect with anyone interested in sustainability, fresh produce and agriculture. If you would like to hear more about us or would like to chat please get in touch.\n\n",
