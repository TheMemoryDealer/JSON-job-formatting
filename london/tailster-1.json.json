  "description": "About Tailster:\nTailster.com is a start-up backed by one of London’s best known VCs, with marketing, social media and branding investment from BBH Global and Zag Ventures. \n\nWe want to make the lives of dog owners easy and stress free – helping them find great homes for their pets when they go away, and a better alternative to kennels. We use tech to create great tools that help sitters and walkers build their business, as well hopefully allowing anyone who wants to earn money taking care of dogs, the opportunity to do so! \n\nThink of it as an Airbnb for Pets! Check out Tailster.com for our site – you will help us shape and create a new more exciting product with some innovative functionality.",
