This is nothing new - cats continue to be the industry underdog as legacy FMCG companies have never formulated cat food for cats as obligate carnivores despite it being an absolute biological necessity. \n\nWe're launching a world leading personalised nutrition and wellness brand for cats and their parents. \n\nWe are doing this through world-leading expertise (including leveraging the best US expertise available), using technology for in-house production and personalisation, to offer the best possible food, and in time will make it accessible and affordable for every cat and their parents. Our brand celebrates cats as companions at the heart of the home, and while we are laser focused on our core food proposition, we will build a one-stop club for cat parents. \n\nWe're at the start of a very exciting journey.
