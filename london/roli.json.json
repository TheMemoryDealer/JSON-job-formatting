ROLI BLOCKS and NOISE are a new, modular music creation system that lets anyone shape music through easy-to-learn gestures on powerful devices that connect together. The award-winning Seaboard RISE and Seaboard GRAND instruments — adopted by world-renowned artists like Stevie Wonder and Meghan Trainor — are an evolution of the piano keyboard that open new dimensions of expression. Professionals and people who have never played an instrument are making music in new ways through ROLI’s ever-growing ecosystem of Connected Music products.  \n\nROLI has raised over $50 million from leading investors including Foundry Group, Balderton Capital, and Founders Fund as well as Universal Music Group. “The most important company in music technology right now” (Music Tech magazine).",
