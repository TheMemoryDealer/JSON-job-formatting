  "description": "The world's first emotion-detection AI for wearables.\n\n$1 trillion: Annual cost of depression and anxiety in lost productivity.\n750 million: Workdays lost due to mental illness.\n1 in 5: Proportion of adults in the US that experience mental illness in a given year. \nTwo thirds: Fraction of people with a known mental disorder who never get help.\n800,000: Number of people who took their own life this year.\n\nMental health is a growing problem, fuelled by social media and unhealthy online behaviour. But technology is not inherently ‘bad’. What if it was more human?\n\nWe’re developing a scalable solution to the growing mental health problem. Our patent-pending AI detects human emotion from heartbeat data collected by wearables. We're better than the leading university groups, and we're only getting better. Come and join us!",
