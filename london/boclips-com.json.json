  "description": "Outside the classroom video informs, engages and entertains. Forecasted to account for 80% of all content on the internet by 2019, it must play the same role in the classroom moving forwards. The beautifully produced video content on television every night, that mirrors so well what is taught across lifelong learning, should be used to bring curricula to life – to captivate, contextualize and inspire debate. Yet, despite the education industry now spending over $170bn pa on e-learning projects, and real demand for more video in e-learning materials, adoption of video has been slow. With backgrounds in the worlds of TV and film, Knowledgemotion’s founders recognized, through extensive market research, that there were significant hurdles to overcome before video becomes a natural part of learning.\n\nboclips aggregates short-form video content from the world's best video brands onto one cloud-based platform, making it easy for education providers to find, license and use videos.",
