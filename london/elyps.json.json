      "description": "elyps, what is it? \nThe community-driven payment account that rewards ethical choices. By invite-only.\n\nelyps is the first community-driven payment account, by invite-only, bringing together a community of members who want to have a positive climate impact.  \n\nIn layman’s terms, how does it work? 🤔 \n\n• Upon registration, all members become shareholders, for free\n• Each purchase made on a product sign-posted by a green leaf in our app will be rewarded with ‘ethicoins’. \n• Each member is free to choose his preferred environmentally-friendly charity or association to donate the “ethicoins”, encouraging members to make eco-conscious purchases and collaborative choices\n• Each member receives tailored marketplace offers that perfectly match and anticipate their needs, when they need them, powered by artificial intelligence.\n\nelyps, who are we? \nEarly 2017, when he discovered blockchain technology, Vincent, decided to leave San Francisco and return to Europe to create elyps. Soon after having met the Belgian financial authorities to create a new kind of bank, late 2017, Mat, a Mobile & Fintech specialist joined Vincent to found elyps.

      "description": "elyps, what is it? \nThe community-driven payment account that rewards ethical choices. By invite-only.\n\nelyps is the first community-driven payment account, by invite-only, bringing together a community of members who want to have a positive climate impact.  \n\nIn layman’s terms, how does it work? 🤔 \n\n• Upon registration, all members become shareholders, for free\n• Each purchase made on a product sign-posted by a green leaf in our app will be rewarded with ‘ethicoins’. \n• Each member is free to choose his preferred environmentally-friendly charity or association to donate the “ethicoins”, encouraging members to make eco-conscious purchases and collaborative choices\n• Each member receives tailored marketplace offers that perfectly match and anticipate their needs, when they need them, powered by artificial intelligence.\n\nelyps, who are we? \nEarly 2017, when he discovered blockchain technology, Vincent, decided to leave San Francisco and return to Europe to create elyps. Soon after having met the Belgian financial authorities to create a new kind of bank, late 2017, Mat, a Mobile & Fintech specialist joined Vincent to found elyps.
