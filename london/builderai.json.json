  "description": "Our platform empowers anyone with an idea and no know-how create and operate the lifecycle of any bespoke digital project with our 3 products, including: \n\n1. Builder. Builder is an online assembly-line platform that uses AI, a marketplace of building blocks and a marketplace of teams (sourced from the capacity network of 75,000+ technical and creative resources from 132 dev shops [as of May 2019]) to build tailor-made software.\n\n2. BuilderCare. BuilderCare guarantees your bespoke software stays up-to-date. This ensures projects run smoothly post-launch, and continue after third-party libraries such as Facebook APIs are updated. \n\n3. CloudOps. CloudOps leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning to optimize the management and expenses of cloud infrastructure. The result: a single, discounted bill for all other services. ",

Like us, you take product development, API, Analytics and ML or AI platform engineering seriously; you’re passionate about technology and, even more so, about leadership. We embrace those who see things differently, aren’t afraid to experiment, and who have a healthy disregard for constraints. That’s where you come in. We are currently seeking an engineering Technical Lead to drive technical vision and execution as well as provide architectural and functional leadership to a team of engineers in an innovative and fast paced environment. Our selection process will emphasize software engineering and architecture skills as well as SDLC or scrum process organizational skills equally. The ideal candidate must be a master of the engineering domain and be able to contribute as an individual contributor (software engineer and architect) at least half of the time. We are looking for someone who is equally comfortable leading by influence or authority. Last, we are looking for a rare mix of intelligence, integrity, domain knowledge, verbal agility, and diplomacy which allows you to rapidly earn the trust of technically astute engineers and product astute product managers.\n\n\nWhy We Need This Role\n\nWe are looking for a leader to help us build out a set of AI powered tools and services which will allow us to pro-grammatically assemble licensed client applications from the building blocks of code. This includes, but not limited to, developing ESB technology that will serve as assembly foundation for said assemblies to programmatic orchestration of underpinning infrastructure. We want to do this to disrupt and automate software development in a similar fashion Henry Ford’s assembly lines disrupted and automated car manufacturing.\n\nWhy You Should Join\n\nThis is a challenging and diverse role that requires you to build both, an organization and new generation of Builder Assembly product, nearly from the ground up.
