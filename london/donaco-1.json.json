  "description": "Donaco is an Imperial College London social startup using novel AI techniques to facilitate online donations and shape content interaction. Using Artificial Intelligence, we dynamically embed a button in articles that recommends relevant charities and empowers readers to take action and donate on content that inspires them. This is done seamlessly within the article itself in just a few clicks. As stories drive interest, we drive people into action.\n\n\nIts contextual technology has strong potential beyond donations into e-commerce, finance or bookings, bringing the paying point closer to readers and enabling one to take action based on their interest in the moment.\n\n\nKey Achievements:\n•\tWinner of Microsoft UK Imagine Cup\n•\tSuccessful first pilot on local newspaper with high engagement rate\n•\tSecured ties with largest UK charities and in talks with media outlets\n•\tEntrepreneurs First (EF9) cohort and supported by Imperial Innovations",
