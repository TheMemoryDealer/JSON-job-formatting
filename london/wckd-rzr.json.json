Based in great space in central London but with the opportunity for flexible working.\nWCKD RZR are looking to build their flagship product which needs to be built the right way. Designed, architected and then engineered; without any of the bureaucracy of an established organisation. Do it the way it should be done, not the way people tell you to do it. It's an interesting technical challenge and there are a lot of \"moving parts\"!\n\nThis is a critical hire for the team. You'll be leading the fledgling team and will be involved in the hiring/growth of the team, you'll be setting goals and designing a technical roadmap. You'll probably have had experience in a similarly fast-paced environment and will share our love of building robust, scalable systems with complete freedom but under tight timelines. We passionately believe in and Agile way of working, fast to fail and quick to change direction as the \nworld around us changes.\n\nYou'll be working with modern Java technologies (though it's ok if you come from a different background) and JavaScript/React in a cloud environment and working with modern DevOps tools (Kubernetes/Docker). It's anticipated the role with be a 80/20 split in favour of hands-on technical work and so you'll still be very much at the \"code face\" but will also be involved in strategy/road-mapping and leading the team.\n\nWe work out of a pretty cool space in London city centre - easily accessible by train, bus or tube - and close to shops/bars.\nIf you're interested, please get in touch",
