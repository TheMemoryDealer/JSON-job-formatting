As a first step, we have set-up a rapidly growing marketplace connecting game developers with advertisers who want to buy non-intrusive, in game-ad formats. We have grown our inventory 400x in 2019 to reach 1B ad impressions per month across 150 game publishers. We sell this unique inventory programmatically to over 500 brands every month. To source content creators at scale, we operate the largest community of VR/AR and e-sport creators, vrfocus.com.",
