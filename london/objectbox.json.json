  "description": "ObjectBox (Techstars '17) is the first high-performance NoSQL, ACID-compliant on-device database for mobile and IoT. ObjectBox is 10x faster than SQLite. It also takes only 1/10th of Lines of Code (LOC) to implement. \n\nThe database is free for maximum adoption. On top of the database, we are building a data synchronization solution. This will be paid as a SaaS.\n\nAs we have seen from transformations on the server space (NoSQL & cloud), connected devices will trigger the next transformation towards edge computing. Since ObjectBox allows any developer to handle more data on small devices, it will become the centrepiece of this.\n\nGitHub: https://github.com/greenrobot/ObjectBox\n\nWe are also the team behind the open-source projects greenDAO (https://github.com/greenrobot/greenDAO) and EventBus (https://github.com/greenrobot/eventbus), which are used by 30% of the top-500 apps on Google Play. To give some examples: Pinterest, Booking, Snapchat are all using our libraries in their apps. ",
