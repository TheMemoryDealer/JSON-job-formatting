  "description": "Experiential entertainment and leisure activities have been evolving over recent years: the explosion in breakout or escape room games being one of the most recent and significant developments. Escape Hunt operates in an increasingly competitive, but fragmented market with relatively few established players in which the majority of venues are run by small local operators. With growing awareness and demand and an almost unlimited customer base spanning families, students, young professionals and corporates, the potential for a professionally run, well-capitalised global organisation is significant. In May 2017, Escape Hunt became the first “escape room” company to list on the London Stock Exchange, marking the growing popularity of this leisure activity among consumers and businesses.",
