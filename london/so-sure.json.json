  "slogan": "Restoring consumer trust in insurance by taking it back to its 17th century roots ",
  "description": "We provide consumers with insurance that is:\n- amazing if you need us (<3days fulfilment vs 4-18days by competition) \n- up to 80% money back, every year, if you don't need us. \n\nWe do so by taking insurance back to its 17th century roots, when incentives were aligned across the value chain and customers got money back when there were no claims. \n\nOur ambitions are global and across consumers lines and we started by addressing the £1bn UK cell phone insurance market. Next year we are launching a new line in the UK and looking at international expansion",
