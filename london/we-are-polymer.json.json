  "description": "Polymer provides online acquisition services covering paid search (PPC on Google, Bing, Amazon), organic search (SEO) and paid social (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram).\n\nPolymer is a new kind of digital performance agency. Founded by one of the leading authorities in the industry, Polymer is an expert at data. But we emphasise the human element too. We get to the bottom of ‘why’ customers are behaving the way they are, and create strategies that work for consumers as well as brands.\n\nData alone is no longer enough; personalisation is falling out of favour. Polymer thinks differently, having over £1bn of search ad spend experience to call upon to power direct response marketing campaigns.",
