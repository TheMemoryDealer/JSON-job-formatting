Your positive attitude is inspiring and you help your team achieve great things.\n\nSoftware knowledge - You know your way around a number of software solutions and have used different cloud products (like Google Sheets, etc). You know what user licenses and common software features are. Maybe you even have experience using project management software.\n\n- 2+ years of marketing, operations or sales experience in B2B tech and/or startups\n- A Bachelor's degree or above with a demonstrable interest in business, technology, statistics or analytics\n- A keen understanding of the SaaS / software market and marketplaces in general\n- Experience working with CRMs, planning and implementing sales and marketing strategies and dealing with B2B clients\n- Experience working with large datasets (Excel, Google Sheets, etc)\n\nOPPORTUNITY\nIdeally, you will work with partners, software vendors, users, and technical colleagues to refine, test, tweak and scale this digital match-making machine. \n\nThere is an immediate opportunity to take charge of this program and become the program manager for the right candidate.
