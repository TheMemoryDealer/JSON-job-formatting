  "description": "Our team is the most accomplished and senior team of specialist employee-side lawyers in the UK. We do not use any junior or trainee lawyers, so you will always be properly advised. Each and every member of our legal team is an outstanding lawyer armed with the knowledge and credentials to overcome employers in settlement negotiations and court cases.\n\nAlthough based in London, we represent clients right across the UK, as we’re able to carry out all  communications via 'phone and email. The only time when it is necessary to travel is to attend courts & tribunals, and we are happy to do this when needed, but the vast majority of our cases settle out of court before they get to that stage.",
