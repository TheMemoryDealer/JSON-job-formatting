  "description": "Project Planet is developing a consumer platform that aims to engage millions of users and businesses around the world, in the fight against climate change by promoting commerce through its APP carbonquo.\n\nThe aim is to offset the entire footprint of each, individual’s daily activity, from the morning shower, breakfast coffee, the commute, shopping, lunch and beyond by driving sales through our consumer partner platform.\n\nProject Planet\nThe project objective is to incorporate retail based companies from around the world, on a single commerce platform, representing all market and industry sectors, from energy providers and air travel, to fashion and high street coffee shops.\n\nEach participating company partner will pay a % of the total outlay, that a customer chooses to spend with them, 100% of the funds obtained are invested to offset each individual’s daily carbon footprint.\n\nPowerful marketing initiatives such as Project Planet which engage both businesses and consumers worldwide can actively avoid the catastrophic consequences of global warming, safeguarding the planet for our children and future generations.\n\nImagine if you will, the possibility of being able to offset everyone’s daily carbon footprint everywhere, not by imposing sanctions, levees, or taxes, but by simply giving each individual the ability to offset their own carbon footprint, through the businesses they choose to buy products and services from.\n\nBy placing the power in the hands of the consumer, we are able to offset each individuals daily carbon footprint by driving purchasing decisions thus generating  business development, sales revenue and commercial advantages for those companies who partner with us.
