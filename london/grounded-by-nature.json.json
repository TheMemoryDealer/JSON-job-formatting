  "description": "Our plant-based protein shakes will be the first 100% natural plant-based protein shakes in the UK market. In a market which has historically been dominated by diary and sugar filled functional drinks, we provide a plant-based, low sugar option without any artificial rubbish. \n\nOur product comes at a time where dairy consumption is in decline and plant-based product sales are on the rise. As a result, we‚Äôre playing to consumer needs by bridging a much needed gap in the functional beverage market, which is otherwise saturated with dairy products.\n\nAfter almost 6 months of development we have created a product which delivers genuine function whilst tasting great. All of the plant-based protein shakes currently on the market have failed to deliver a product with acceptable taste at the expense of having a high protein content. After extensive research & development we have created a unique recipe that delivers over 20g of protein while tasting and feeling like a dairy milkshake.\n",
