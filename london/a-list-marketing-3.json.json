  "slogan": "A nano-influencer marketing platform that connects local businesses with local influencers",
  "description": "A-List is creating a highly automated digital platform where local brands/businesses such as restaurants, bars, nightclubs, salons, etc and nano-influencers (customers who love the business/brand) can find each other and carry out mutually beneficial campaigns.  \n\nFor years, many great ideas, people, products/services, and businesses have gone by unrewarded whilst having exceptional potential. It is often because these companies never truly mastered the science behind how to get people, who love their products, to talk about it, and share the message to attract more people, more attention, and more revenue. While other big businesses can often depend on their huge financial resources to get the name out, many start-ups and SMEs with limited resources remain under the radar, struggling to get the recognition they deserve. A-List Marketing exists for the sole purpose of making these great ideas/businesses/people truly great in the eyes of the world and get them the glory that their dedication and skill merits.  \n\n",
