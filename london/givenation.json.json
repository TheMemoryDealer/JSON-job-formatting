  "description": "In short: GIVE is a blockchain-based ecosystem that teaches sustainable financial literacy, we onboard trusted charities, so while kids learn, earn, save, invest; they can also give, and be rewarded to do so, resulting in much needed soft skills. We are creating a huge social impact and supporting kids; while they save the world! \n\nOur mission for a better tomorrow has been scientifically proven as achievable through the United Nations ‚ÄòSustainable Development Goals. Brilliant and globally recognized scientists are directing the world on how to stop and prevent further damage to our planet; while GIVE Nation empowers children to become real superheroes and join them in their pursuit of saving the world!\n\nGIVE Nation is a gamified ecosystem for children easily accessible on smart devices. Our ‚ÄúCitizens‚Äù enjoy learning and practicing sustainable financial literacy while being rewarded for philanthropistic actions!\nGIVE transforms pocket money into a plethora of incredible opportunities, with the help from the partnerships of our successful educational platforms, charities and business partnerships; We teach kids to; save, invest, earn, spend wisely, and of course, to GIVE!\n\nGIVE Empowers Kids\nWhen GIVE Citizens complete a task improving the planet, our technology will generate a digital recognition. This shows children that giving is not only rewarding in the long term, but can also have immediate benefit. Neuroplasticity and the science of conditioning behaviors have proven, the younger we practice the art of giving, the more likely we are to continue, improving our mental and physical health. Acting together, we can all support the planet and ensure future generations continue to make a positive impact in efforts for a better future.\nPartnering with GIVE\nThe GIVE Nation Ecosystem is launching in primary and secondary schools located in London, allowing students nationwide to participate in our fun literacy program.
