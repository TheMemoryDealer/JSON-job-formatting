Someone who wants to learn whilst delivering quality.\n\nYou would be working as a frontend developer within one of our product focussed teams, working closely with other frontend developers, backend developers, QA engineers and the team‚Äôs product manager to deliver changes and new functionality.

We render our applications on the server so users get the best possible perceived performance. We scale with ease using AWS, launch staging environments via our Slack bot and automate JIRA away so you almost don't notice it‚Äôs there.\n\n[http://stackshare.io/festicket/festicket](https://workable.com/nr?l=http%3A%2F%2Fstackshare.io%2Ffesticket%2Ffesticket)\n\n**METHODOLOGY**\n\nWe're an open-source first company who understands the value of working publicly on Github.
