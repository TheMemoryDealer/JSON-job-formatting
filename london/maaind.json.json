  "slogan": "Highly personalized real-time mental state feedback tech+app",
  "description": "We're building a fundamentally new approach to AI, combining explainable AI (XAI) techniques, sensors - and in particular Brain Computer Interfaces (BCIs), to build highly personalized and trustable/explainable models of individual mental states. We call this tech bio-XLP. Our product, now in development, is an app that uses this to give users real-time feedback on their mental state - real-time neurofeedback. Users do not need to have wearables/sensors/BCI for the tech to work - we use BCIs and wearables during the training phase of models and where available from the hardcore QS people who do use existing BCIs or other wearables.\n\nIn the longer-term, the goal (obsession) is to build up the software+algorithmic infrastructure for enabling real-world Brain Computer Interface usecases - it's not enough to build the hardware, as some people are. We need the software and models to go along with interfacing to the human body and brain. This is what we are building at Maaind.",
