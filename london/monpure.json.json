  "description": "The scalp should be at the heart of any haircare regime.  You might be applying all manner of lotions and potions to your lustreless locks hoping to wake up the next morning with a magnificent mane befitting a Pre-Raphaelite muse. Yet all this time, your scalp remains an after-thought, unloved and neglected as the moon by day – when in fact, it’s the root cause of healthy hair. \n \nMONPURE are a collective of beauty experts, dermatologists and scientists who are dedicated to scalp and hair health, together with finding real solutions to issues like hair loss and thinning. Everything in our results-driven range stars nourishing botanicals and potent actives sustainably sourced from all over Europe, which are supercharged in our German laboratories so they can work at their full potential. \n\nOur formulas are free from the usual culprits (sulphates, silicone and parabens) and all testing processes are vegan, cruelty-free and non-toxic. What’s more, we use suppliers that we have hand-picked for having the highest ethical standards.\n \nOur packaging shouldn’t end up in a landfill either – the glass bottles can be fully recycled and our plastic containers are both recycled and recyclable. \n\nHence if healthy strong hair is what you’re coveting, discover MONPURE for yourself. Your neglected scalp will thank you for it.",
