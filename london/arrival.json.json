We are working with some of the world's leading businesses and governments with the goal to re-define how cities look, think and feel. Our vehicles will be 100% built by robots and are autonomous-ready.\n\nWe recently announced a trial with the Royal Mail, we are the Official Electric Truck Partner of the FIA Formula E Championship, and we supply the components to the first fully electric and driverless race car and racing series, Roborace.\n\nFunction and form without compromise. Our core components: motors, power electronics, battery systems, HMI and LV systems are 100% designed and manufactured in-house.\n\nWe’ve assembled some of the finest minds in software, engineering, AI and robotics and we need to grow, but grow slowly to ensure only the world's best come and join us.\n\n",
