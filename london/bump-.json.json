  "slogan": "The ultimate marketplace for authentic fashion (YC W18)",
  "description": "At BUMP we're building the ultimate marketplace for new & used authentic fashion, starting with streetwear & sneakers from brands like Supreme, Off-White, Nike etc.\n\nOur vision is to let people shop for limited release fashion in a way that’s as easy as traditional ecommerce today. We’re putting authentic fashion from both the primary and resale markets all in one place - whether you’re looking for something brand new from Gucci or a used Supreme x Louis Vuitton Hoodie.\n\nWe’re not only building the easiest way to shop the most diverse range of fashion but we’re striving to do this in a sustainable way. By promoting the recycling of used products over just always buying the latest new thing, we’re enabling both shoppers and brands to unlock more value from their wardrobes at the same time as having a favourable impact on the environment.\n\nFounded in 2016 and based in London, we're already backed by leading names in venture capital including Kleiner Perkins, eventures and Y Combinator.",

Online shopping killed this and we&#39;re bringing it back for Generation Z.</p>\n\n<p>On BUMP users can build up their public profiles, follow &amp; message anyone on the platform and even create their own group chats. Plus, we&#39;re working on introducing even more epic social features that allow kids to hang out and build their online identity with us which in turn drives transactions - we&#39;re a marketplace fuelled by a social network.</p>\n\n<p>In the future, shopping online will be more of a multiplayer game so we&#39;re building the place where the most social generation ever can shop with their friends online.</p>\n\n<p>We&#39;re growing fast too. Last year we went through Y Combinator and we&#39;ve just announced a $7.5M Series A round of funding from leading names in venture capital including Kleiner Perkins, e.ventures and Y Combinator to redefine social shopping. </p>\n<h3>The Role</h3>\n<p>We’re looking for an Android Engineer that’s motivated to help us build our marketplace for today&#39;s teens.
