  "description": "Prime Advocates is a not-for-profit law firm and social finance consultancy providing legal, impact metrics and  advisory support to a range of clients including impact investors, social enterprises and responsible businesses. As a social impact market maker, we support clients who are seeking to positively influence the UN SDGs.  Prime Advocates’ unique not-for-profit business model creates a continuous cycle of positive social change. Revenue generated from our fee-paying clients subsidises the pro-bono/low-bono support we provide to innovative social enterprise start-ups who would otherwise not be supported. Alongside the provision of legal, financial, strategic consultancy and impact metric consulting, we accelerate the development of social finance through best practice tools and knowledge sharing. This work is undertaken through the impact projects of our charitable arm, the Prime Advocates Foundation. All our profits are returned to this Foundation to further our purpose.",
