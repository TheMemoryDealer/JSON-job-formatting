  "description": "This will in the future provide commercial and sports venues with a way to cut down on queues, increase customer satisfaction and eliminate the unofficial ticket reselling market. For offices, we prevent the possibility of employees switching cards, and employers from footing the bill for absent workers. \n\nWhile being the most convenient way to enter any facility it is also the most secure method, that gives facility managers the potential to partially or fully automate their check-in and entry system. Our device was designed by a previous red dot award winner, to create the right first impression for client-facing businesses that wish to leverage the most cutting edge technologies available in their workplace. \n\nOur system easily integrates into your existing security ecosystem, requiring minimal time for installation. We also put data privacy and protection at the core of our values and are fully GDPR compliant.",
