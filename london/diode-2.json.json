  "description": "We are building a business to help companies bring on board electric vehicles.  The key to this is making sure you select the right vehicles for your needs, but also crucially you implement the right infrastructure to support this. \n\nWe help them assess their requirements, understand their use cases, give them the tools to understand their site capability, outlay specific recommendations and then procure it all through a network of partners. \n\nWe are structuring this as a \"free tool\" to explore the benefits for businesses, then they have a self-serve or managed option to procure the recommendations.  \n\nWe are working to deliver this as a software solution, but also a bespoke service where required.",
