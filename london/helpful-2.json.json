  "description": "HELPFUL is the world’s first plastic recycling and rewarding app. We are encouraging people to live a plastic-free life by making recycling and reusing easy and rewarding. We would like to play our part in reducing the 2.5 billion of cups and 7.5 billion water bottles, we are currently using every year in the UK. \n\nThe app identifies the plastic and guides the user how to recycle it,  if one of our HELPFUL Bins is nearby, it directs them there to ensure it’s been recycled properly. \n\nHELPFUL is the world’s first plastic recycling and rewarding app, using the power of AI and smart bins technology to connect to existing public bin infrastructure to help people break the plastic habit by rewarding them for recycling, reusing and reducing single plastic usage. \n\nWe are partnering with some of the UK’s leading brands, retailers and shopping centres to enable them to recycle their coffee cups and water bottles. \n\nThe HELPFUL app is available for iPhones and Android smartphones.
