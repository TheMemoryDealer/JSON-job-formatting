About building something which will be seen and recognised by both businesses and consumers?\n\nIf so, then let's talk!\n\nAt Metomic, we're building something new. We believe data was made to be shared - but this can only happen if we can *know and trust* what's being done with it. We're building the tools and plugins that enable any online company to provide that control back to their users. \n\nWhat you'll be doing:\n\n- You'll have ownership of the React front-end for the Metomic Dashboard - the place a company goes to manage its own relationship with Metomic\n- You'll have ownership of a consumer-facing JS library, which enables Metomic to be integrated into any website (currently using preact)\n- Working very closely and effectively with a 3-5 person agile dev team\n\nWhat you need:\n\n- 2+ years experience in front-end technologies.\n- Experience with the React ecosystem\n- An understanding of build systems and bundle optimisation (webpack/grunt/parcel etc)\n- Strong design skills across all platforms\n\nAs an added benefit, you might have:\n\n- Some design chops\n- Some experience with devops\n- Working knowledge of practicalities of scale: CDNs, cache management, bundle optimisation etc\n\nWhoa whoa wait, the salary?\n\nOf course. We believe in hiring good people, and paying them well. This is a big role, it comes with a decent salary. We‚Äôre also offering equity, because we want everyone to be in the same boat.
