We provide online mental health support groups and workshops guided by professional therapists and coaches in specific areas (anxiety, stress, etc…).\n\nOur goal is to remove the stigma around mental health and self-care by creating a fun, relaxed and anonymous environment where people are encouraged to share their experiences and learn from each other in groups guided by certified professionals, while also making it more affordable so more people can benefit.\n\nHow we work:\n- We are a very agile, bureaucracy-free environment\n- We like people that have a lot of initiative and do things on their own\n- We love people that are passionate about what they do\n- We don’t believe in rigid working hours\n- We don’t really require that people come to our office either (but you kinda have to be around so we can have meetings and stuff)\n- We do, however, believe work must be fun!
