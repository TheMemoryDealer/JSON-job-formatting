  "description": "talent.io is the first selective, targeted and innovative European recruitment platform for software engineers and developers. \n\nIt is the simplest way for software engineers to find great jobs in innovative companies.\n\nOur process is simple: We select the top 10% of engineers who are looking for a new job and make them visible on talent.io for 4 weeks only. The companies directly apply to the candidate who decide who he/she want to talk to. \n\nWe currently operate in Paris, Lyon, Lille, Bordeaux, Toulouse, London, Hamburg, Berlin and Amsterdam. \nOver 150,000 developers and 3,000 companies (including Deezer, Blablacar, Parrot, N26, Monzo, Edited and many of the best startups in Europe) have already signed up on the platform and thousands of offers are made every week to software engineers.\n",
