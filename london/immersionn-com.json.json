  "description": "We allow people become virtual travellers and discover new VR & 360 content they have never seen before.\nThere is a lot of 360 and VR content out there but it cannot be seen. \nThat's because the VR platforms act as the content gatekeepers.\n\nWith our WebVR Discovery platform, we power the decentralisation of content recommendation and help creators monetise. Our solution is device agnostic leveraging the web for universal access.\n\nThis September 2019 we are launching the first element of our application 'Immersive News and Documentaries' in collaboration with 2 European news medias partners. Our goal, for this part of the application, is to become a central point for immersive news discovery across a panel of diverse worldwide medias.",
