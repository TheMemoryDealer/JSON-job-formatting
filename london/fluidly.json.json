DevOps to me is a specialisation within the dev team, someone who helps and guides developers to deliver and support their own features in production, so I'm looking for someone who shares that vision. Security is a must, but they will need to implement it pragmatically, and not hamper the speed of delivery, so they must be delivery focused.”\n\nWhere you can have impact\n\n* This is a green field project, you’ll be owning everything DevOps at Fluidly for the long term and be making decisions that impact our short and long term growth.\n* DevOps culture! You're not a dumping ground for anything vaguely infrastructure related. You are here to solve the mind bendingly difficult problems of scaling and help engineers to self serve.\n* The infrastructure is largely for you to define, we will need to set up multi-region to support the US market, whilst ensuring that we are compliant and minimal maintenance overhead.\n* We do continuous deployment, so there's no staging environment!

You will help the developers self-serve, not just be a dumping ground for everything DevOps.\n* Experience with YML based CI/CD pipelines (we use CircleCI).\n* Experience of kubernetes and associated technologies.\n* You will have worked in an environment with 99.99+% up-time - and you will understand a meaningful measurement of that statistic\n* A good, pragmatic understanding of security.\n* Bonus Points for:\n** Working under FCA or PCI compliance regimes\n** Supporting BIG data pipelines in GCP\n\nKnowledge:\n\n* You’re ideally product focused and understand the balance between speed of delivery and quality.\n* If you have experienced scaling a system / team that’s also great, we would love people who have built up experience in this area.\n* You’ve failed at things before. You’ve seen it, lived it and learnt from it and can help us identify potential pitfalls.\n\nBehaviours:\n\n* You ain't gonna need it (YAGNI).\n* You’re a great communicator and want to understand the commercial impact and play nicely with product.\n* You know when to be decisive and when to ensure decisions are made quickly and efficiently.\n* You have strong opinions weakly held - you can defend a position, but give it up easily when consensus is against you even if you're right.\n* You’re humble, no room for brilliant jerks\n\nBenefits\n\nMore on us\n\nWe strive to create an inclusive workplace where people have the opportunity to succeed, regardless of gender, gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, marital or civil partner status, race, religion or belief, disability, age or pregnancy.\n\nWe embrace difference and know that if you can be yourself at work, you'll be happier, more motivated and creative.

We recently got recognised for our hard work by making into Wired’s top 10 European startups.\n\nWe’re now looking for a driven and enthusiastic business developer to develop and qualify our pipeline opportunities. We’re a small, but friendly team and you’ll have a lot of opportunity to progress quickly in the role.\n\nWhere you can have impact\n\n* You’ll be one of the first two SDRs in the business, so you can have an immediate impact on Fluidly’s growth and also input into the direction of the team.\n* You’ll work closely with the Account Executives to hand off warm, developed leads and work with them to understand the needs.\n* You’ll be a Fluidly ambassador at events.\n* Develop and implement outreach strategies that you will formulate with our Sales leaders here - PS they’ll be on hand at all times to give you great training and the best start in your early SaaS career.\n\nRequirements\n\nWho you are\n\nSkills:\n\n* You’re an expert at finding the right person to speak to and working out how to get in touch. No gatekeeper is a match for you.\n* You know how to dig to the heart of a customer’s needs quickly, getting their attention and making sure you can pitch Fluidly in a way that works for them.\n* You’re super organised when it comes to lead management.\n\nKnowledge:\n\n* You’ve ideally been here before (although SaaS experience isn’t a necessity) and you’re confident selling into clients and our partner network.\n* Familiarity with a CRM like pipedrive or Salesforce would be excellent.
