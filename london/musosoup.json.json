We are looking for someone who shares our vision, who can dedicate some time to this project and can meet weekly (out of normal working hours). \n\nSo, if you have great front-end developer skills,  have some spare time, and want a new and potentially lucrative challenges please get in contact. \n\nAs you will be creating a new front end from scratch (replacing our existing bootstrap theme) we are pretty open to working with whatever technology you specialise in, as long it’s fit for purpose. \n\nWe look forward to hearing from you!",
