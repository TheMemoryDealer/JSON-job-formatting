  "description": "I enjoy starting businesses, like a one-man incubator. As a 'Founder not CEO' (https://simpletom.co.uk/2018/04/05/founder-not-a-ceo/), I work alongside people much more talented than I am to found new businesses, giving me the capacity to work on multiple projects at the same time. I focus specifically on people and businesses that do good and make money. \n\nCompanies include Brilliant Africa (Brilliant Ethiopia & Brilliant Uganda), Ventures Together, Wholi, Campfire, Tenner, Bright Green Talent, Blue Ventures and many others. \n\nI also mentor and advise founders and I am continually on the look out for entrepreneurial talent who want help starting their businesses.

I invest significant time and some money to bring ideas to reality, and continue to try to support businesses as they grow as a mentor. \r\n\r\nWhy?\r\n\r\nStarting and growing a business is one of the most rewarding, meaningful and impactful things you can do. But it's a hard and lonely road, which usually requires a huge array of skills, choices and knowledge. \r\n\r\nToo often, people make very simple, avoidable mistakes that can drastically decrease both their chance of success and enjoyment.\r\n\r\nAfter 20 years as an entrepreneur starting and running my own businesses I’ve a fair bit of experience of what works and what doesn't. I've become a Founder, not a CEO (https://simpletom.co.uk/2018/04/05/founder-not-a-ceo/) - meaning I help other people start businesses.\r\n\r\nWho?\r\n\r\n“Who you work with and what you work on are more important than how hard you work” - http://www.twitter.com/naval (Founder of AngelList)\r\n\r\nI look for two things: good companies, and good company - companies that do good, run by good people - people I’m inspired by and want to be friends with when I’m 100.\r\n\r\nYou\r\n...will be/have:\r\n\r\n- Relentlessly resourceful - http://www.paulgraham.com/relres.html\r\n- Some entrepreneurial experience\r\n- Smart - a decent degree is usually a good proxy, but other indicators work too\r\n\r\nYou...don't need:\r\n\r\n- A ready-to-go idea, I have plenty (and they rarely survive scrutiny anyhow)\r\n- To be based somewhere specific\r\n- A co-founder\r\n\r\nMe\r\n\r\nI’ve founded a dozen businesses in 5 countries, raised $10m+ from VCs and angels, hired hundreds of people, run an executive search firm recruiting people for others, spoken at conferences (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZBo1j5Zmbo), invested in companies, been a trustee and executive director of charities, done accelerators in Silicon Valley, built a house from scratch in Kenya, got two business degrees (with scholarship from Oxford - although learning about business isn’t nearly as useful as doing it) and failed A LOT.

This differs from venture to venture, but I try my hardest to ensure this is both fair, in your best interests and will help you if you ned further investment elsewhere. There's no 'set' amount, and you can always say no. I encourage us to discuss this early and openly. I believe in agreements where both parties feel lucky.
