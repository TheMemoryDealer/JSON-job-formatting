  "slogan": "Carandaway will revolutionise car ownership through peer to peer car sharing proposition",
  "description": "Car & Away is a revolutionary well funded start-up which, at its heart, enables private car owners to rent their cars out when they are not using them. Think Airbnb for cars. Our brand purpose is to become the smartest peer-to-peer car sharing community globally and reduce the cars we need on our planet by 20%. \n\nUniquely, Car & Away began at UK airports offering car owners a new choice to park and earn by renting their cars out while away. Using these cars we disrupt traditional car rental businesses by giving renters the exact car they book - no counters, no queues and no hidden extras. \n\nStage two of the business is where it gets really big - activating airport acquired owners to rent their cars from home. Enabled through keyless instant book technology Car & Away will be the first platform in Europe to have 100% of cars instantly bookable.\n\nThis is a rare opportunity to join an exciting business that will transform the way in which we own and use cars.",
