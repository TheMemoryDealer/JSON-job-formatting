  "slogan": "Boutique Strategy Consultancy Specialising in Disruption",
  "description": "RE_SET is a boutique strategy consultancy specialising in disruption. We work at Board level to assess and activate value created through business disruption and innovation. Project work varies greatly, from short PE due diligences (e.g. evaluating new players looking to transform their market), to long-term innovation transformation programmes (e.g. large corporates needing to re-invent their business through an agile and innovative cultural change project). Our clients so far span multiple industries, including travel & tourism, property, retail, financial services and the public sector. \n\nA key pillar of our business mission, and one of our differentials, is the fact that sustainability underpins our business: we are a 1% for the Planet business and a pending B Corp. We’re about driving positive change and creating real value – for the world, our clients and for us. If a project is not striving to bring about this positive change, we won’t do it. ",
