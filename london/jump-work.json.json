Your journey and progression will reflect this, offering huge potential to grow and develop, just as many of our core members have done, and become a pivotal member of the Jump team.\n\nWhat are we building?\n\nWe founded Jump to empower professionals and businesses to grow and succeed through a deeper understanding of what makes them unique.\n\nWe want to make tailored job advice available to every person and business. That’s why we’re on a mission to build the world’s first conversational talent platform, through which both businesses and professionals can personalise their search, engage with each other, and create meaningful matches to help them take the best next step for their growth.\n\nBy using behavioural data to personalise the job search of professionals, we turn the problem on its head. Whereas big job boards attract lots of mismatched applications that businesses have to filter through, Jump’s AI engines are targeted at attracting the right professionals in the first place - by helping them understand what could be a good fit for both their interests and skillsets.\n\nWhy join now?\n\nIf you want to be a part of a big, ambitious story, Jump is an amazing business to work in with a super exciting and executable vision - you’ll work with a cutting-edge, interdisciplinary team.

Therefore, we are looking for someone who is passionate, willing to put in the work (and get s*%! done!), and excited to grow with us as a person and professional to Series A and beyond.\n\nThis means that you will:\n\n- Engage in practical applications of our job recommendation engine on existing professionals and jobs\n\n- Work on the day-to-day acquisition of new users using existing channels through specifically targeted campaigns such as LinkedIn and targeted engagement\n\n- Create and test the performance of new channels to attract new users to the platform \n\n- Take ownership of your analytics and reporting in order to track, inform, and ultimately improve your performance - as such, some Excel or SQL experience is a great plus\n\n- Support teams with ad-hoc project support and gain insight into each team and how they operate - this is a great opportunity to explore your strengths and where you would like to develop in your career\n\n- Develop an understanding of what it takes to drive success and growth within a start-up environment\n\nWhat We’re Looking For From You:\n\n- Great Attention to Detail: this means owning your work output and feeling a strong sense of responsibility for the quality impact, and timeliness of everything you do \n\n- Passionate about problem-solving: Whatever the situation, you are always excited to break down problems and think of novel and exciting solutions to large and complex issues\n\n- Honest & Open-minded: Feedback and evaluation are part of parcel of your successful career development, meaning you are very open to receiving all kinds of feedback from all members of the team.
