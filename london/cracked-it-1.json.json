You will be their go-to person when they need support from us. You’ll do the professional equivalent of making sure our corporate partners’ wine glasses are always topped up. \n\n- Charm the pants off our customers at our repair clinics…Not literally. But you’ll be our charmer-in-chief at our repair clinics, guiding our customers through them with efficiency, warmth and delight. You’ll be a shining example of customer service to our ex-offender trainees. You won’t need to repair - our Master Technician and young techs have that covered.\n\n- Manage customer queries from Cracked It HQ: In addition to front-of-housing our repair clinics, you’ll pour your heart into making sure our customers get jargon-free repair support from our tech specialists. \n\n- Test out some bold marketing tactics: You’ll let your imagination run wild to try out new promo stunts, making our repair service irresistible to those clumsy/unlucky potential customers who need their broken tech fixed.\n \n\nWhat we’re after\n\n- You’re a people-lover: You’re a natural when it comes to reading people, understanding what makes them tick, and responding accordingly. You’ve worked or volunteered in a people-facing role before.\n\n- You’re a full-time solution-finder: You can re-purpose old knowledge to fix new problems. Your blood boils when your great ideas have to get rubber-stamped by five departments before they’re put into action (none of that at Cracked It). You don’t cover up your mistakes. Instead, you help yourself and others to learn from them.\n\n- You can spin a lot of plates at once: You’re so organised that you can manage simultaneous demands from our customers and partners without losing your cool, losing sight of your goals, nor losing your magic touch. Any event-organising experience you have would be great evidence of this.\n\n- You feel confident rubbing shoulders with the big dogs: As a small start-up, we punch above our weight by partnering with multinational corporates. You’ll be able to speak their language - and may even have experience working with (or in) corporates before.\n\n- You care enough to get stuck right in: You’re invested in our social mission to support ex-offenders. You’re not precious about rolling up your sleeves to get the job done, whatever it might be.\n\n- You’re hot on deadlines: You hate lateness. So do we.",
