  "description": "Organisations are looking towards machine learning to help them build a one-to-one relationship with customers and make better decisions. But data scientists are in short supply, and developing machine learning in-house is expensive and time-consuming.\n\nSeldon is the open-source machine learning platform for enterprise-grade recommendations and predictive analytics. Its end-to-end solution includes proven algorithms, industry models, and a pluggable microservices architecture. Seldon is platform-agnostic with no vendor lock-in. You keep full ownership and control of your data on-premise or in the cloud.",
