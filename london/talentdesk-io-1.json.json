With a strong emphasis on project management and regulatory compliance, the platform makes it easy to manage multiple projects while removing the hassle of payments.\n\n**Who backs us**\nWe are part of PeoplePerHour.com, UK’s leading freelancer marketplace with over 12 years of experience in the freelance industry. With 1 in 3 people currently working freelance, and the expectation that this will increase to 1 in 2 by 2025, we strongly believe this is the future of work and it will fundamentally change the way companies operate and think about the way they discover and use talent.\n\n**Our Tech Stack**\nThis is an outline of our current tech:\n- Clean,  test-driven isomorphic codebase build using async ES6/ES7\n- NodeJS backend built using ExpressJS\n- ReactJS frontend with a Redux-based data-flow layer and styles managed via SASS\n- Code bundling via the Webpack module bundler\n- CircleCI for CI/CD\n- MySQL, Redis and Elasticsearch data-stores\n- Micro-services packaged as docker containers and deployed on kubernetes\n\n**Your skillset**\nAs a full-stack engineer, you will:\n- Work with ExpressJS and React/Redux together with a curious and experienced team of Senior Engineers\n- Ensure your solutions are well designed and appropriately load-tested\n- Keep pushing the limits in JavaScript, Node.js, React, ELK and more\n- Ensure you and your teammates are following best development practices Share your knowledge and learn from your teammates\n\nMoreover, you should:\n- Embrace agile principles\n- Think analytically and methodically with high attention to detail\n- Act like an owner and be selfless while being accountable and goal oriented; in short, get things done!\n- Value honest feedback and constantly try to raise the bar.\n- Be proud of the code you produce. Admittedly, nothing is perfect and so refactoring is your friend. You always like to leave the code better than you found it, in fact, it's how you code every day.\n\n**Perks**\nA few of the many perks of joining the TalentDesk.io team:\n- Competitive salary with an annual pay review\n- Equity depending on the level of position - we are in this together, right?\n- Flexible work\n- Days off - We encourage breaks and freshness so we expect you to be with your loved ones on your birthday and name day! Oh and those important school days where you want to be with your children!\n- Work with great colleagues of excellent calibre and ambition that code for fun!\n\nIf you feel you have the right skillset and attitude to tick all of these boxes please reach out and let's talk!\n\n*We are quite flexible about location and working hours; however, for inter-team synchronization purposes, we require some overlap with our regular business working hours (UTC+02:00/EET).",
