      "description": "Houzen is hiring equity partners to grow the business!\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have had ~3 years of strong growth now, and have successfully landed in a pre-series A growth stage. We are now 21 FTEs strong. In terms of leaders, we have two GMs, the founder himself and a strong \"foundation team\" who lead marketing, product, and asia expansion - who all have earned shareholding in the company. Houzen strongly belives in a long term and sustainable growth model, where we want to build and grow the company with a strong skin in the game culture. Due to several reasons and drivers, houzen (including our investors) now very confidently believes that we will continue to run and grow over the next 2 to 3 decades hence we are building for massive scale and hence looking for enterprising leaders who want to scale up their careers in a lower risk environment. \r\n\r\n\r\nFor this reason, we are open-mindedly experimenting with a new concept of bringing onboard \"equity partners\". Equity partners are common in law firms and consulting firms where strong partner level people come in with their own clients / skills / background and small investment to help grow their own P&amp;L through the firms platform with a strong skin in the game. We want to deploy the same logic and bring leaders for \r\n\r\n\r\n(i) operations (head of, or COO, Chief of commercial)\r\n\r\n(ii) technology (CTO, VP Engineering)\r\n\r\n(iii) Data science / Deep tech (Chief Data Scientist, head of deep tech)\r\n\r\n(iii) product (Chief of Product)\r\n\r\n(iv) institutional/private equity, (head of PE, Chief of Investments)\r\n\r\n(v) sales/business development (head of acquisition, head of sales, head of customer success)\r\n\r\n\r\nWe would expect these leaders to invest in the business (on discounted favorable terms) so they have a skin in the game, and we would expect them to run a part of the business as if it was their own!\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAbout the company:\r\n\r\nHouzen is building a global stock exchange for residential real estate. The company values the strong consulting rigour however the real differentiator would be someone who can roll up their sleeves and get stuff done. Think of all roles as a 90:10 split between execution: strategy, or strategising in evening, and implementing during the day! The equity partner roles will transition into P&amp;L leadership (title- regional/country GM/head of ops), or head of customer acquisition (who scales up sales, business development, partnerships team). Even with a specialist background you must have a generalist mindset; as your role is expected to keep strengthening and potentially changing as the company expects unprecedented growth over next 12-24 months. Direct responsibilities would be to lead either people/functions, accounts, or regions. You would be seen as a future leader from day one. Houzen is also currently pitching to clients in Germany and France hence local language or work experience would be an added bonus. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe Company Houzen is a fast growing property tech venture which aspires to match properties with customers i.e. tenants/buyers in “real time”. Houzen works with some of the most prestigious institutional landlord accounts in UK, and competes (and outperforms easily) head-on with the largest six global RE agencies such as Foxtons, Savills, JLL et al. Houzen’s customers are large landlords and developers as supply (who own 500-1000 or more units) and small and mid-size letting and estate agencies on the demand side. Houzen investors include some of the most prominent and influential angel investors from across Europe - they are mostly ex-clients of the founder from his PE days, and are partner level execs at leading PE / RE / Tech funds. Their advisor is the ex-global CFO, Deutsche Bank, who previously used to be the global CFO at BMW group. In ~two years of building the business, the founder has successfully installed a repeatable and scalable institutional sales and delivery model. Houzen now works with hundreds of real estate agents across the UK (and China). Supply has grown 5-6x since August 2018 and is expected to grow another 3x by May 2019. As one could imagine, with successful sales comes the need to structure, optimise and build for scale and hence the need to bring in enterprising professionals to take the business to the next level. All these roles would work alongside the Founder as his right hand in helping optimise client delivery, and customer acquisition (on both supply and demand sides). \r\n\r\n\r\nThe Founder was a Senior partner at a global M&amp;A/PE shop himself - he values the consulting/banking work ethic and wants to start hiring through an equity partner model to grow with a skin in the game and sustainable scalability mindset. He would mentor these equity partners/future leaders closely over time, and prepare the company for a 20-30 year scalability so that all shareholders partake in the growth and financial payoffs in the end. Previously the founder Saurabh also helped grow (internationally) and exit a restaurant SaaS business for $220m in little over two years of inception. \r\n\r\n\r\nEach person at Houzen is customer-focused first, team-focused second and role-focused third. Everyone is expected to go to any length to understand the customer inside out and genuinely work towards finding solutions for their needs, and then go the extra mile each time to delight them. Every team member is very inclusive and collaborative (and a bit unreasonably crazy!). Houzen strongly believes that only strong and determined teams build strong businesses, and hence each new team member should be aligned to our philosophy and work ethic. \r\n\r\n\r\nRequirements (Important)\r\n\r\nYou must have a clear reason for why you want to work with an early stage business such as Houzen other than to get out of a predictable corporate job, brag to your friends about the cool start-up you now work with, or simply place entrepreneurship on your CV. Some of us have an uncanny “need” and “eccentricity” to want to build stuff, lead people from the front, challenge the status quo even if it came with difficulties, pain, and low upfront monetary benefits. Only reach out to us if you think you are the latter. \r\n\r\n\r\nFor P&amp;L equity partners: 2-4 years experience at a top-tier consulting firm (preferably BCG, Accenture, Bain) + 1.5+ years in a start-up previously or has attempted to build a business in the past.\r\n\r\nYou must have in the past led teams or situations as a person, professional or a sports person. Undying ‘‘won’t give up at any cost’’ attitude and has an ‘‘eternally optimist’’’ view on life Respects the ‘‘Customer is King’’ philosophy. Loves learning new concepts and solving problems, and won’t leave the drawing (and more importantly execution ground) board till the problem is solved. Is excited about rewriting the rules of a $220tn asset class. Wants to potentially build a business themselves in future. Since customer orientation and team dynamics are so important for us, we would love to see tangible evidence of when you served difficult customers, led teams, played competitive sports, or in general, led yourself or your team towards winning! Worked and lived in multiple European countries, but not necessary. European languages also ideal Location: London, the with potential to travel (or be based in Europe in future)\r\n\r\n\r\nSalary/Compensation: TBD for equity partners. We can sit down together and model out a modest annual compensation of 20-40K GBP (based on needs) + direct profit share (linked to revenue generation or fundraising targets for company) + ESOPs + the purchased equity on discount. In year 1 itself, opportunity to take home 50k-150k or more depending on your capability.",
