  "description": "The product uses M.L and C.V to give farmers a better understanding how to feed their fish: the largest cost of producing a fish and a large pollutant to the oceans if the feed is not eaten. The machine learning learning and the computer vision work in tandem to suggest the optimal amount to feed, health flagging and other alerts.",
