  "description": "We create apps and software that enhance the daily lives of people living with disabilities or other difficulties. We work closely with communities and individuals to identify the everyday problems that can be solved by technology. \n\nWe have more than 8 years experience in inclusive app design and development in both the education and healthcare sectors. We work closely together with universities to research and develop new innovations that make our apps more accessible and save money to the NHS. \n\nTherapy Box was founded in 2010 by Rebecca Bright MBE and Swapnil Gadgil. Rebecca has a background as a speech therapist and Swapnil comes from a technology background. Together they created the first switch accessible app to allow people with motor neuron disease, cerebral palsy other difficulties to communicate. Since then they have been focused on growing Therapy Box and creating apps to help people with a range of communication difficulties, autism, and learning difficulties.",

Acoustic features of speech data to ascertain the risk of adult neurodegenerative conditions.\nand others like it...\nTherapy Box is a health tech team based in West London, with a mission to use speech and language digital biomarkers for screening and ongoing monitoring of neuro conditions in young and adults. www.therapy-box.co.uk \nWe setup Therapy Box 10 years ago with a vision to bring mainstream tech to benefit the disabled. We launched text to speech communication app, Predictable, for those with motor neuron disease, which is now the go to app for those with MND. It is regularly featured on app store, built for 10 different languages, NHS is our biggest customer, the biggest markets are UK, US and Germany and we have sold hundreds of thousands of copies of the app. The app has changed people's lives.\nWe now are taking on ever greater ambitions. We have been funded by the National Institute of Health Research (NIHR) to develop a screening tool to detect the risk of developmental language disorders in children between the age of 4 to 8. This 2-year project would deliver the biggest citizen science programme of data collection, which would deliver the data to build the product, which would then be taken to a clinical trial in 3 hospitals, followed by launching it to market as a tool. There is no product like ti today. The underlying technology would pave the way for acoustic and language signals to be used to detect adult neurodegenerative conditions like parkinson's, Alzheimer's and other dementias. \n\nA bit more about the current team;\nWe are 10 of us, with a wide-ranging skill-set of clinical, project management, design, web dev, app dev, QA, marketing and academic research. We work with specialist collaborators like universities, NHS hospitals, PR agencies and so on. \n\nWhat would be your role?\nYou would be our first embedded ML expert. You would work closely with the clinical director, CEO, dev teams, PMs and so on internally. You would also work with external teams where there are university professors and researchers in ML and clinical capacities. You would help shape the core problem statement, define it from ML perspective, setup infrastructure, pre-process data, pick suitable models, train, test repeat!\n\nWhat would your role not be?\nYou won't have to collect or procure data. You would neither train others nor be trained.\n\nWhat would be a suitable academic background?\nYou may either have a bachelor, master or doctorate in science or maths field.\n\nWhat would be your ML and tech skills?\nYou would have proved commercial experience in machine learning that goes beyond personal projects. Experience within speech and NLP would be a significant advantage. You would have undertaken 5 or more projects, preferably with major participation and a good understanding of end to end process. This is not an internship role. You would be expected to know whether to use RNN or LSTM while solving NLP problem sets and why.\n\nWho would fit in the team?\nWe are a team of like-minded individuals who are all independent, self-motivated, driven with a view of building life-changing products. We are a friendly and supportive team.\n\nMore about the role;\nThis role would require a minimum of 2 days and up to 5 days per week. This would be a contract or permanent ongoing position, which would be mutually agreed. This role would be based in our West London office.\nWe offer many perks:\n\nSalary and benefits offered;\nWe can't offer you the packages that Google or Amazon could. However, we would more than compensate for it with the platform to build on world-leading tech, solving real-world problems,  freedom to architect a solution, write academic papers and most importantly change lives.\n\n- 20 days holiday (and bank holidays)\n- Company pension\n- Hundreds of Perkbox team benefits including free coffee, phone insurance, discounted cinema tickets and more\n- Regular on-site and off-site team events\n- A relaxed and friendly work environment\n- Travel within the UK and overseas (Europe, America and different areas of the UK are visited often by some of the team)",
