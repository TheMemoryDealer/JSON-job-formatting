  "description": "envoPAP is a sustainable materials solutions startup utilizing green technology to provide agricultural waste with a second life. Our materials are made from the waste of sugarcane fibres after harvest and extraction of cane juice. Use of envoPAP has helped save circa 760,000 trees and using waste resources to generate finished further large scale products. \n\nCurrently, envoPAP is present in 40+ markets in Central and Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa. In just 4 years since inception, envoPAP has grown from a studio startup in St. Johns Wood in London to Offices in London, New York and Pune. Last year marked the launch of envoPAP Research in Chennai & London. We have also started a representative office in Ethiopia marking our entry into the hub for coffee packaging. envoPAP is currently used in Communications, Food-Pack, Labels, Publishing, Agro-Pack, and further research in the process to use envoPAP in Liquid Packaging Applications.
