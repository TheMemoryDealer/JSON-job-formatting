  "slogan": "Transak is an integration for applications to globally onboard users from fiat to crypto and back",
  "description": "Crypto and blockchain applications have the potential to change the world. Tokenisation, composability, democratisation and openness can make applications fairer and better. Crypto applications want to reach a global and mainstream audience who expect to deposit and withdraw with fiat using local payment methods. Transak solves that. By reducing the barriers that exist between the fiat and crypto worlds, we allow everyone to have seamless access to crypto applications.\n\nBy focusing on aggregating banking infrastructure, compliance, liquidity, payment processing and seamless user experience we abstract away the complexity of the fragmented fiat â†” crypto ramps that exist today. \n\nSo that our partners can focus on building their applications and launch globally from the get go.",
