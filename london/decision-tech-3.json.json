This critical data intelligence gives us - and our partners - the opportunity to make faster and smarter decisions for our businesses motivated by customer satisfaction and product monetisation.",

We apply cutting edge KPI driven development practices while still upholding the principles of the Agile Manifesto and Test Driven Development practices. \r\n\r\nWe have ambitious plans for our price comparison products both improving our current online experiences and for new product verticals.

We use AngularJS to perform comparison in real time on the client’s browser. Our site is localised for 2 different territories. We use NoSQL data stores and leverage a service orientated architecture. Code is kept up to date and technical debt prioritised and removed.
