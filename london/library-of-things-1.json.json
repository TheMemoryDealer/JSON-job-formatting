  "description": "Library of Things lets you borrow the Things you need, when you need them and learn skills from your neighbours ...\n\nWe build community by lending out useful items like drills, sound systems and sewing machines, and helping neighbours share skills. This means you can rent a hedge trimmer or projector as easily as a Zipcar or Santander bike from your local ‘self-serve rental kiosk'. ",
