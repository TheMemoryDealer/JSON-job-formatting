  "description": "Zego is a global insurtech business providing flexible commercial insurance for businesses and professionals.\n\nZego was created by people who come from the on-demand economy. Whilst working for Deliveroo, Harry and Sten saw the way in which drivers wanting to work flexibly were constrained by their insurance. \n\nDrivers working ten hours per week were paying the same as those working sixty hours - as a result, the cost of this required insurance was too high, and flexible working wasn’t flexible at all. \n\nHaving looked across the market for a product, and with no success, it was clear there was a need and so they set out to create the product themselves.\n",
