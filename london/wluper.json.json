  "description": "Teaching machines to understand natural language is extremely complex and is considered the holy grail in the field of Artificial Intelligence. Extracting and providing relevant and useful information from the right places is even more challenging and with current approaches ultimately impossible to scale. \n\nWe're at the intersection of Natural Language Processing and Knowledge Base creation, and aim to bring them together by leveraging state-of-the-art deep learning.",
