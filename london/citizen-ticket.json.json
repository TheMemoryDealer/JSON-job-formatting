From every ticket sold on Citizen Ticket, we contribute 5p to planting a tree to create a sustainable future for our planet.\n\nWHO WE ARE\nWe are a group of event organisers and developers that formed Citizen Ticket in 2013 to respond to the numerous problems we saw within the event ticketing industry. Industry incumbents, ticket touts, counterfeiting, inflated booking fees and secondary ticket websites were extorting event organisers and attendees to generate unethical profits.\nWe believed that there could be a better way, and today we are proud to deliver an ethical service that reflects the positive nature and ethos of the events that we work.\n\nTHE TEAM\nWe have a team of highly talented and driven individuals, with a strong and growing team culture. The current team consists of 9 people in total (including founders) and intends on growing to 12 in the next 6 months. Our development team currently consists of 4, spread over the online platform, the app and the server infrastructure.\n\nTHE CHALLENGE\nCitizen Ticket is rapidly expanding, increasing the pressure and expectations of the online platform to meet event organisers needs, and provide a streamlined e-commerce solution for ticket purchasers. \n\nCitizen Ticket requires a dedicated full stack web developer to maintain and optimise the online platform, and continuously innovate new solutions for a scaling business, to ensure sustainable growth. \n \nTHE ROLE\nWe are looking for a primarily PHP developer to work across our web platform, but the successful candidate will have to have diverse full stack capabilities. The candidate will work alongside our lead developer and will be supported and mentored by our CTO. During the course of the role, the successful candidate will be expected to develop their skill set.\nAfter probation, there will be creative opportunity given to work on projects outside of this scope decided by the candidate (“20%” time).\n\nTHE SKILL SET\n- Full stack web development with a variety of languages including but not limited to PHP, JavaScript & HTML\n- A strong understanding of MySQL databases\n- Minimum 5+ years programming experience\n- Experience with using Git (Gitlab experience a plus)\n- Must be a self-starter, able to motivate and manage themselves effectively.\n- Strong desire to build something and to work in an innovative, dynamic and fast paced company\n- Polite, well¬ mannered, excellent written and verbal communication skills. - - Able to simplify, articulate and convey technical aspects to non-technical team members\n\nBONUS POINTS\n- An understanding and or interest in the application of Blockchain technologies.\n- A Computer Science related degree\n- Experience in React Native & Node JS",
