  "description": "GSWDH stands for George Samuel Waller Design House. It's a name I have picked and worked under for about 5 years now, only recently becoming a limited company. \n\nI'm an individual who is highly driven to succeed in life. For me, succeeding is becoming financially independent so I can pursue my love for travel and creativity. In order to do this I have many ideas and many avenues however I need people to help me get there. In return, I would like to help that person achieve success in their life. I want to form a team in it for the long run!\n\nNow, what GSWDH does. The ultimate product is IP generation in electronics and software; a design consultancy. GSWDH has many clients, they are in the geotechnical monitoring industry (current projects on London Underground, Network Rail and council owned infrastructure), consumer beauty products (high wealth individuals funding), VR, medical devices (sold around the world) and more. GSWDH develops systems for clients as well as for its own product line in development. \n\nThe bottom line is GSWDH undertakes awesome, high value projects while generating very high quality designs in process. Those interested in working with GSWDH should be highly motivated, driven and passionate about engineering.",

      "description": "This isn't a normal role but an invitation to a business partnership. GSWDH (George Samuel Waller Design House) is an umbrella for all the work I undertake. GSWDH is a design consultancy that works for clients and itself developing products of its own. There are only so many projects an individual can undertake; the idea of the partnership is to combine talents to create a sum greater than its parts. This means the partner will bring work to the table, or at least have the ability to so, as well as come up with and work on new, shared ideas. GSWDH already has plentiful income waiting for a partner in the form of freelance work from existing jobs. My expertise is in electronics hardware design, mechanical design, system architecture, manufacturing (small and large scales) and product design. I also have a large and healthy network of potential clients and engineering services.\n\nGood communication is key so you need to be very proficient in English and ideally sociable! I live in a town easily commutable to London which means I'm there most days of the week - I also travel to the European continent multiple times a month. The potential partner must be based in central Europe.\n\nThe position sought is a very flexible one where there are no fixed hours - just deadlines. You can pick whatever projects you would like to work on as long as they make business sense. Personal and side projects are entirely fine - no jealousy/control freaks here!\n\nBelow are two current projects. The others can only be discussed under NDA. \n\nOsprey Measurement Systems. \nI am a cofounder of Osprey and it's my major occupation. Osprey develops geotechnical monitoring equipment for the building and preservation of civil structures. Devices are already being deployed on London Underground and Network Rail and there is a large list of more products to come. These products are high precision sensors measuring angle, pressure, temperature, distance etc and communicating this data via novel wireless networks for processing. Skills needed here are for microcontrollers and embedded Linux. This participation would be paid by the hour or as a salary.\n\nSoke Lighting\nSoke Lighting is an internal project entirely owned by GSWDH. Soke Lighting is aiming to produce high end lighting fit for any interior with a very easy to use controller. Here, skills are needed in FreeRTOS running on ESP32 modules and experience with the Espressif SDK. Products are currently in development and engineering prototypes are nearly finished. The business plan is currently being worked on and funding will be sought within six months. This would be a joint venture initially paid with equity.",
