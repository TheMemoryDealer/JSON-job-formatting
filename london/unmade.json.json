Don’t worry if you don’t have all the skills and experience we’re looking for today - apply anyway! In fact, many of our colleagues started here with little experience and learnt on the job.\n- We believe that what you build is just as important as how you build it, and that technology is just as much about people as it is about code. We are building a product where people with little to no technology experience can be involved in an element of the creative process, and are constantly thinking of ways to make it better and more seamless.\n- We strive to be transparent in everything we do, and share both our successes and failures with the rest of the team. As a result, we’re comfortable that even if things don’t always go as planned, we are always doing our best.\n\nAbout the role:\n\nWe’re building a SaaS product, and you will be building upon existing systems and help shape the architecture of the platform. Our technology stack covers everything from graphics programming and order processing and systems integrations to custom language compilers for industrial knitting machines.\n\nOur architecture consists of services and Django web applications. We use Django Admin to control the end-to-end flow of product creation, from allowing our customers to customise their designs, to getting the machines to print, knit, or embroider their fashion products, to sending the specs to factories, to finally delivering their finished product.
