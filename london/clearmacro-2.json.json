  "description": "CM provides institutional investors with a front-office software/service solution that processes rapidly changing data/information into live investment signals.  It makes decision-making easier, helps improve portfolio returns, expands the user’s investment coverage, and increases the transparency and consistency over time of their decision-making.\n\nWe believe institutional investors are navigating a number of key trends: pressure on fees and cost structure and exponential growth in available data but limited ability to leverage it effectively. CM was created to provide investors with a viable data strategy to ensure that data provides a performance edge and not a cost.",
