  "description": "Brands like Puma, Topshop and Tommy Hilfiger use EDITED every day to make sure they have the right products, at the right price, at the right time. This is the most important thing to get right in the apparel business, and is how all the value is created or lost in the industry.  Our product is used by buyers, planners and trading teams to generate a huge competitive advantage, and effectively, lets apparel retailers behave more like Amazon, (and use less guessing!).\n\nEDITED retail technology is the industry standard for real-time analytics of pricing, assortment, demand, and competitive metrics. The company was founded in 2009 and has rapidly expanded, with offices in New York, London and San Francisco. Our clients are spread across all continents (except Antarctica!), in countries as diverse as Italy, South Africa, Russia, India, Australia, South Korea, the US & UK, and many more.\n\nHear our team talk about what it's like to work at EDITED at https://edited.com/jobs/",
