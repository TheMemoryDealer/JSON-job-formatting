  "description": "Saw & Sew officially launched during the 2019 London Design Week and was featured in the Evening Standard, Icon Design Guide and The World of Interiors.\n\nWe're already making cool chairs with well known artists and famed fashion houses.\n\nBased on what we've learned,  we're developing a platform to host a community of enthusiasts, designers and producers that develop, share and sell furniture products and services based on the companyâ€™s proprietary designs and processes. \n\nWe want to democracize furniture design and production so it's accessible to everyone and made-to-order locally.\n",
