I have learned more via Rungway than I have in nearly any other avenue. It creates a safe, positive, helping community. \n\nGlobal Managing Partner, Heidrick & Struggles\n\nWe launched Rungway following feedback that some of our juniors were not getting the support they needed from their immediate line manager when they needed it. The idea was why be limited to just one manager when you could access advice from hundreds. So much of culture lies under the surface – but Rungway helps bring issues into the open. I highly recommend it. \n\nManaging Director, Head of Culture and Client Marketing, UBS Investment Bank\n\nCulture is a top priority for us. We already use employee surveys and chat systems. Rungway allows individual, anonymous questions, and is very different. It sends a message that whoever you are, whatever your role or location, your voice matters. \n\nCEO, Standard Life Aberdeen",

Can I qualify the difference between different types of supporter? <br>\nDo I have a proven understanding of sales process and past experience of successfully qualifying leads? Do I take pride in constantly measuring, improving and scaling a sales process in order to achieve great results?</p>\n\n<p>About Rungway<br>\nBusinesses using Rungway can understand and solve problems earlier, and gain unique culture insights. When our clients talk about Rungway, this is what they say:</p>\n\n<p>There is no greater value to me as a manager, friend, and colleague, than having the opportunity to truly listen to, and hear, concerns and questions that my co-workers are grappling with. I have learned more via Rungway than I have in nearly any other avenue. It creates a safe, positive, helping community. </p>\n\n<p>Global Managing Partner, Heidrick &amp; Struggles</p>\n\n<p>We launched Rungway following feedback that some of our juniors were not getting the support they needed from their immediate line manager when they needed it. The idea was why be limited to just one manager when you could access advice from hundreds. So much of culture lies under the surface – but Rungway helps bring issues into the open. I highly recommend it. </p>\n\n<p>Managing Director, Head of Culture and Client Marketing, UBS Investment Bank</p>\n\n<p>Culture is a top priority for us. We already use employee surveys and chat systems. Rungway allows individual, anonymous questions, and is very different. It sends a message that whoever you are, whatever your role or location, your voice matters. </p>\n\n<p>CEO, Standard Life Aberdeen</p>\n",
