The problem is the lack of an easy, cheap, and scalable way to detect the disease early enough.  \nSubtle changes in an Alzheimer’s patients’ speech appear 20-30 year before routine clinical diagnosis, and – with good enough technology – can be detected reliably. Let’s get to work.  \n  \n**“… sorry, your name was?”** Novoic.  \nWe’re a small, but fast growing, driven team of Oxford/Cambridge machine learning researchers, neuroscientists, clinicians and the exCEO of a top pharma company, backed by some of the best venture funds in Europe.  \nLast year we developed a test that detects Alzheimer’s (and other neurological disease) from a few minutes of speech, recorded from a patient, 10-20 years before routine diagnosis.  \nWe’re also nice.  \n  \n**“How can I help?”**  \nWe’ve already completed proof of concept studies with really exciting results, and now it’s time to set up larger scale clinical trials to validate the technology further and in other diseases.  \nThe tech is game-changing and proven.The societal impact will be huge.Our team is great.Dozens of leading neurologists are keen to work with us.  \nThis means that there are many great opportunities for public funding available out there to help rolling out this technology. It will help millions of people and families, who’d otherwise suffer greatly – but compared to our ambitions and current growth we’re severely understaffed and need a superstar intern (you) to help us seize all of these opportunities.  \n  \nStarting ASAP, you’d be working directly with our founder/CEO and another key employee to- Identify the and evaluate most eligible grants and alternative funding opportunities.- Formulate strategy for the selected competitions.- Conduct extensive market research/analysis on Novoic's commercial opportunities.- Help manage relationships with our existing clinical/academic partners, organise co-applications for grants.- Writing the core of the applications.  \n  \nCrucial to our alternative funding strategy is fine-tuning our commercial strategy and doing incredible market research/analysis. Understanding our competitor landscape, customers and go-to-market strategy will increase our funding upshots.   \nIn short, you’ll be in charge of finding the best grants/funding competitions to apply for, creating a strategy for the applications, doing background market/customer research and analysis, writing the initial drafts, and finalising the applications.  \n50-70% of your time will be spent writing the applications and doing the necessary market/customer research to make those applications absolutely stand out. In this process you’ll be representing the very best R&D in the field, and this needs to be reflected in the final applications.  \nThis includes writing/editing summaries of the scientific literature, learning what are the problems that grant/competition focuses on and how to communicate those perfectly (including the hidden ‘rules’ of grant writing which you’ll get from our team, your own research, and working with funding bodies and the best professional grant writers out there). 10-20% of time will be spent finding new competitions and academic/clinical partners we could co-apply with and then managing those relationships.  \nYou’ll have constant help from us and professional grant writer consultants we (or you?) will also hire. That said, this is not a dumb support role – we hope you’re up for the challenge to be proactive be the main driver of getting grant funding for our projects. Although a junior role, there’s close to unlimited responsibility you can earn, if you do good work.  \nThe rest of your time you’ll be working on whatever you find most exciting/impactful within the company – you can work with us setting up the trials you’re getting extra funding for, work with the technical team, help us with business development, etc.  \n  \n**Who we’re hoping to meet (you!):**  \n- Available to start ASAP part time (20+ hours/week) or full time.- Available to stay with us for at least 3 months; candidates that can stay at least 6 months will be prioritised.- Preferably based in London, so that you can join us in the office once remote work arrangements end – this is important to us to make the team cohesive and in sync.- A superwoman/man. Someone who can work with our team to get (a lot of) work done, quickly. We don’t want you to hang around and make coffee – that’s not fun for you or really helpful for us to make lives better for patients.- Equipped with great scientific writing skills; producing consistently better output than your peers; high on creativity and comfortable with yourself as a writer.- Incredible market research/analysis skills with experience in financial modelling and business planning.- Someone with good analytical skills and intuition so evaluating and mapping out grant competitions can quickly become a piece of cake for you.- Comfortable with reviewing literature thoroughly and critically.- Extraordinarily proactive; both in pursuing your individual work, and building relationships with the people in and outside of the team that would help you best succeed in your role.- Preferably someone who worked in a fast-paced and idea rich environment before, where open and honest communication is central.- Want to learn a lot and work with some other great human beings.  \n  \n**What we’d love to give you if you join:**  \n- Insight, exposure, hand-on experience into how an early-stage venture funded deep-tech/biotech startup works. We are a small team and fully transparent. You’ll work directly next to and with the founders and most welcome to attend/shadow/organise meetings. You’ll see how clinical trials are organised, a healthcare product is built, a team is built, the biggest pharma companies are sold to.- Skills. By default you’ll get amazing at market research/analysis and writing grant applications (taught by the best professionals we/you can hire) which is a skill we wish we had picked up sooner.

The problem is the lack of an easy, cheap, and scalable way to detect the disease early enough.\n\nSubtle changes in an Alzheimer’s patients’ speech appear 20-30 year before routine clinical diagnosis, and – with good enough technology – can be detected reliably. Let’s get to work.\n\n\n\n\n“… sorry, your name was?”\n\nNovoic.\n\nWe’re a small, but fast growing, driven team of Oxford/Cambridge machine learning researchers, neuroscientists, clinicians and the exCEO of a top pharma company, backed by some of the best venture funds in Europe.\n\nLast year we developed a test that detects Alzheimer’s (and other neurological disease) from a few minutes of speech, recorded from a patient, 10-20 years before routine diagnosis.\n\nWe’re also nice.\n\n \n\n\n“How can I help?”\n\nWe’ve already completed proof of concept studies with really exciting results, and now it’s time to set up larger scale clinical trials to validate the technology further and in other diseases.\n\n- The tech is game-changing and proven.\n- The societal impact will be huge.\n- Our team is great.\n- Dozens of leading neurologists are keen to work with us.\n\nThis means that there’s a many great opportunities for public funding available out there to help rolling out this technology to help millions of people and families, who’d otherwise suffer greatly – but compared to our ambitions and current growth we’re severely understaffed and need a superstar intern (you) to help us seize all of these opportunities.\n\nStarting ASAP, you’d be working directly with our founder/CEO and another key employee to\n\n- Identify the and evaluate most eligible grants and alternative funding opportunities.\n- Formulate strategy for the selected competitions.\n- Help manage relationships with our existing clinical/academic partners, organise co-applications for grants.\n- Writing the core of the applications.\n- Find and collaborate with professional grant writer consultants on writing/finalising applications.\n\nIn short, you’ll be in charge of finding the best grants to apply for, creating a strategy for the applications, doing background research and analysis, writing the initial drafts, and finalising the applications.\n\n50-70% of your time will be spent writing the applications and doing the necessary research to make those applications absolutely stand out. In this process you’ll be representing the very best R&D in the field, and this needs to be reflected in the final applications.\n\nThis includes writing/editing summaries of the scientific literature, learning what are the problems that grant/competition focuses on and how to communicate those perfectly (including the hidden ‘rules’ of grant writing which you’ll get from our team, your own research, and working with funding bodies and the best professional grant writers out there). 10-20% of time will be spent finding new competitions and academic/clinical partners we could co-apply with and then managing those relationships.\n\nYou’ll have constant help from us and professional grant writer consultants we (or you?) will also hire. That said, this is not a dumb support role – we hope you’re up for the challenge to be proactive be the main driver of getting grant funding for our projects. Although a junior role, there’s close to unlimited responsibility you can earn, if you do good work.\n\nThe rest of your time you’ll be working on whatever you find most exciting/impactful within the company – you can work with us setting up the trials you’re getting extra funding for, work with the technical team, help us with business development, etc.\n\n\n\n\nWho we’re hoping to meet (you!):\n\n- available to start ASAP part time (20+ hours/week) or full time.\navailable to stay with us for at least 3 months; candidates that can stay at least 6 months will be prioritised.\n\n- available to work with us in person in London regularly – this is important to us to make the team cohesive and in sync.\n\n- A superwoman/man. Someone who can work with our team to get (a lot of) work done, quickly. We don’t want you to hang around and make coffee – that’s not fun for you or really helpful for us to make lives better for patients.\nequipped with great scientific writing skills; producing consistently better output than your peers; high on creativity and comfortable with yourself as a writer.\n\n- Someone with good analytical skills and intuition so evaluating and mapping out grant competitions can quickly become a piece of cake for you.\n\n- comfortable with reviewing literature thoroughly and critically. Preferably in the process of or have completed a science/neuroscience BSc/Msc/PhD.\nextraordinarily proactive; both in pursuing your individual work, and building relationships with the people in and outside of the team that would help you best succeed in your role.\n\n- preferably someone who worked in a fast-paced and idea rich environment before, where open and honest communication is central.\nwant to learn a lot and work with some other great human beings.\n\n\n\n\nWhat we’d love to give you if you join:\n\n- Insight, exposure, hand-on experience into how an early-stage venture funded deep-tech/biotech startup works. A real, great one 😉 We are a small team and fully transparent. You’ll work directly next to and with the founders and most welcome to attend/shadow/organise meetings. You’ll see how clinical trials are organised, a healthcare product is built, a team is built, the biggest pharma companies are sold to.\n\n- Skills.

      "description": "Research Engineer - NovoicPaid. Full time.Biotech AI startup detecting brain disease from speech  \n  \n**“Great to meet you - what brings you here?”**  \nAlzheimer’s disease and other dementias will affect 1 out 3 people (~same as all cancers combined) yet there isn’t a single disease-modifying drug on the market. The problem is the lack of an easy, cheap, scalable way to detect the disease early enough.  \nSubtle changes in an Alzheimer’s patients’ speech appear 20-30 years before routine clinical diagnosis and – with good enough technology – can be detected reliably. Let’s get to work.  \n**“... sorry, your name was?”**  \nNovoic.  \nWe’re a small, but fast growing, driven team of Oxford/Cambridge/Stanford machine learning researchers, neuroscientists, clinicians, and the exCEO of a top pharma company, backed by some of the best venture funds in Europe. We’re also a team of humans. Humans who are ambitious, humble, weird, brilliant, and here to get to work to solve some fundamentally hard problems. If we succeed the rewards will be almost inconceivable. And we come to work every morning (or afternoon depending on circadian rhythm) with a deep sense of meaning. We’re many more things, which you’ll experience if you come and talk with us.  \n  \n**“How can I help?”**  \nWe’ve made real progress to solve this problem. We’re the furthest ahead in building something that’s sustainable and scalable; that will work in the existing landscape now, and as it’s changing. But we still need a lot of help. And we need the extraordinary kind.  \n  \n**“Why do you need my help right now?”**  \nWe’re already by far producing best-in-class research in NLP, speech/language understanding etc and a major bottleneck for us is capacity – having more hands to do great ML implementations here. That said, we know there are many even better ideas out there we haven’t thought of and need people even smarter than us, that we can work with to work out what those are.  \n  \n**“What kind of person are you looking for?”**  \n- Bursting with ML ideas (particularly deep signal processing, NLP, audio and text representations – and things we don’t know yet are important; tell us). Every time you read a new paper (which is often) it sparks a rich range of applications, related ideas, or combination of ideas.- Natural communicator of complex concepts. Can read an ML paper and explain it to your grandparents in an engaging way (including grandparents that didn’t work on neural net models in the 70s).- Obsessive doer that executes well. Someone who feels they always need to code things up that they read in papers (or better yet– code something up that’s better or shows how the paper is limited). Hungry for data.  \n  \n**“What will I actually do?”**  \nRead mountains of cutting-edge NLP/DL/signal processing papers, synthesize research and generate ideas (= application of ideas to our domain), synthesis of multiple ideas or entirely new ones.

With good enough technology, these subtle changes can be detected reliably. \n\nWe’re a small, driven team of mostly Oxford/Cambridge machine learning researchers and neuroscientists.

The problem is the lack of an easy, cheap, scalable way to detect the disease early enough.  \nSubtle changes in an Alzheimer’s patients’ speech appear 20-30 years before routine clinical diagnosis and - with good enough technology - can be detected reliably. Let’s get to work.  \n  \n**“... sorry, your name was?”**  \nNovoic.  \nWe’re a small, but fast growing, driven team of Oxford/Cambridge/Stanford machine learning researchers, neuroscientists, clinicians, and the exCEO of a top pharma company, backed by some of the best venture funds in Europe. We’re also a team of humans. Humans who are ambitious, humble, weird, brilliant, and here to get to work to solve some fundamentally hard problems. If we succeed the rewards will be almost inconceivable. And we come to work every morning (or afternoon depending on circadian rhythm) with a deep sense of meaning. We’re many more things, which you’ll experience if you come and talk with us.  \n  \n**“How can I help?”**  \nWe’ve made real progress to solve this problem. We’re the furthest ahead in building something that’s sustainable and scalable; that will work in the existing landscape now, and as it’s changing. But we still need a lot of help. And we need the extraordinary kind.  \n  \n**“Why do you need my help right now?”**  \nCompliance, privacy, and data security are big deals to us. We need more expertise in our team building and scaling secure, compliant infrastructure for handling patient data. We're doing this in the right way. Our infrastructure is a key selling point for us, rather than something that’s simply evaluated as a security risk. And that’s hard and takes a lot of work. We need this to be the best work you’ve already done.We’re growing and scaling up fast. This includes commercial partnerships and running large clinical studies, where we’ll have much more data to be good protectors off.We’re not contracting this work because this is something that will be constantly evolving, needing constant maintenance, and is mission-critical.  \n  \n**“What kind of person are you looking for?”** Experienced. A lot. This is vocational expertise. You can’t learn this from a book/degree. The older and wiser the better. This is 1000% important.Opinionated. You need to have firm opinions everywhere you see it important for security/uptime/etc. Especially if anyone on the tech team asks to do something you’re against. We’re a startup, moving and scaling fast, so this will happen. You need to be able to shout at the CTO if need be.We’ll make unreasonable requests, both in terms of resources, time, feasibility – it’s up to you to stand your ground.  \n  \n**“What will I actually do?”** (Jointly) own the infrastructure - design, build/scale, maintain it; with our team and the help of consultants/contractors if need be.Decide what resources we need (money, internal/external staff) and make a case for/request them.Fight fires: be on call if things go wrong with e.g. the backend during a clinical trial. Once we’re deploying live products at scale, on-call duties will be split between the CTO and any other cloud architect/full-stack people on the team. We share the good stuff and share the boring stuff.Brief, discuss and educate the CTO so they can make the best decisions and talk confidently to customers, investors, etc.Make decisions on our tech stack jointly with the CTO and other members of your team.Be extremely involved in the hiring process for non-research tech hires: design and lead algorithms interviews, intro calls, provide your opinion on candidates to the talent team.  \n  \n**Some must-have requirements** 10+ years in industry as cloud/DevOps/automation engineer. Big company, small company - we don’t care. You just have to be great.Spent your career mostly dealing with security/compliance (healthcare, fintech, etc.).Did all of this on AWS.This is recent experience. AWS changes a lot and keeping up is hard. It doesn’t count if you’ve been out of the full-stack game for years.Very experienced with Java, Python.Anything to do with product/UX/React Native/web dev/app dev is nice, but not a requirement.  \n  \n**What we’d love to give you if you join** Daily challenges, variety, flexibility. An insane learning curve (like the roads in that scene from Inception).Insight, exposure, hands-on experience into how an early-stage venture-funded deep-tech/biotech startup works. A real, great one ;) We are a small team and fully transparent. You’ll see how clinical trials are organised, a healthcare product is built, a team is built, the biggest pharma companies are sold [to.Sense](http://to.Sense) of meaning (and bragging rights) that you have a significant role in changing the way brain diseases are diagnosed, making millions of patients’ lives better. Working on something we find meaningful is something our whole team deeply cares about and if you won’t have the same spark after about the second time you’ve spoken with us, we’re probably not a great fit for you.Flexible working arrangements. If you need to leave early on Thursdays to pick up your kids from school, or work from home on a Monday while waiting for the plumber, go for it. As long as you’re producing insane work (and taking care of yourself/your family in the process), we’ve got your back.6 weeks’ holiday per year.Competitive compensation, including equity.",

We share the good stuff and share the boring stuff.Brief, discuss and educate the CTO so they can make the best decisions and talk confidently to customers, investors, etc.Make decisions on our tech stack jointly with the CTO and other members of your team.Be extremely involved in the hiring process for non-research tech hires: design and lead algorithms interviews, intro calls, provide your opinion on candidates to the talent team.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Some must-have requirements</strong> 10+ years in industry as cloud/DevOps/automation engineer. Big company, small company - we don’t care. You just have to be great.Spent your career mostly dealing with security/compliance (healthcare, fintech, etc.).Did all of this on AWS.This is recent experience. AWS changes a lot and keeping up is hard. It doesn’t count if you’ve been out of the full-stack game for years.Very experienced with Java, Python.Anything to do with product/UX/React Native/web dev/app dev is nice, but not a requirement.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>What we’d love to give you if you join</strong> Daily challenges, variety, flexibility. An insane learning curve (like the roads in that scene from Inception).Insight, exposure, hands-on experience into how an early-stage venture-funded deep-tech/biotech startup works. A real, great one ;) We are a small team and fully transparent. You’ll see how clinical trials are organised, a healthcare product is built, a team is built, the biggest pharma companies are sold <a href=\"http://to.Sense\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">to.Sense</a> of meaning (and bragging rights) that you have a significant role in changing the way brain diseases are diagnosed, making millions of patients’ lives better. Working on something we find meaningful is something our whole team deeply cares about and if you won’t have the same spark after about the second time you’ve spoken with us, we’re probably not a great fit for you.Flexible working arrangements. If you need to leave early on Thursdays to pick up your kids from school, or work from home on a Monday while waiting for the plumber, go for it. As long as you’re producing insane work (and taking care of yourself/your family in the process), we’ve got your back.6 weeks’ holiday per year.Competitive compensation, including equity.</p>\n",

Full time.\nBiotech AI startup detecting brain disease from speech\n\n\n“Great to meet you - what brings you here?”\n\nAlzheimer’s disease and other dementias will affect 1 out 3 people (~same as all cancers combined) yet there isn’t a single disease-modifying drug on the market. The problem is the lack of an easy, cheap, scalable way to detect the disease early enough.\nSubtle changes in an Alzheimer’s patients’ speech appear 20-30 years before routine clinical diagnosis and - with good enough technology - can be detected reliably. Let’s get to work.\n\n\n“... sorry, your name was?”\n\nNovoic.\n\nWe’re a small, but fast growing, driven team of Oxford/Cambridge/Stanford machine learning researchers, neuroscientists, clinicians, and the exCEO of a top pharma company, backed by some of the best venture funds in Europe.\n\nWe’re also a team of humans. Humans who are ambitious, humble, weird, brilliant, and here to get to work to solve some fundamentally hard problems. If we succeed the rewards will be almost inconceivable. And we come to work every morning (or afternoon depending on circadian rhythm) with a deep sense of meaning. We’re many more things, which you’ll experience if you come and talk with us.\n\n\n“How can I help?”\n\nWe’ve made real progress to solve this problem. We’re the furthest ahead in building something that’s sustainable and scalable; that will work in the existing landscape now, and as it’s changing. But we still need a lot of help. And we need the extraordinary kind.\n“Why do we need your help right now?”\nWe’re here to win. We know how to win. You’ll be an important part of this. That’s why we need you.\nData is important to winning our game. Decentralised today with many small institutions running their own studies. We believe there’s power in bringing these smaller institutions together and working with them. More details for late stage candidates.\nMoving fast on this is core part of the CEO's high level strategy, so we need you right now. This is a Special Ops. role and you’ll be working directly with the CEO to execute on this.\n\n\n“What will I actually do?”\n\n- Something not listed here within the first week.\n- But: finding and obtaining access to existing datasets.\n- Building relationships with academic groups, hospitals (or more precisely - building relationships with the right stakeholders there).\n- Brokering IP and licence agreements.\n- Travelling. Sometimes not, sometimes a lot. Sometimes within the UK, sometimes out of.\n\n\nWho we’re hoping to meet (you!)\n\n- This one is hard. Honestly we’re not sure what we need. I’m putting this out because of the asymmetric returns if we happen to get this right for the candidate. But you might know better, who we’re really looking for.\n- Credible to doctors and leading professors. Highly professional.\nIn depth, serious scientific discussions with same. Reads scientific papers Sunday morning.\n- You probably need to be 1:10.000 top communicator/interpersonal skills (high empathy).\n- Exceptional in execution.\n- “Win-win” negotiator (you’ll be assessed on this through the interview process).\n- Into how software is eating biology and healthcare. You need to have some conceptual understanding of how ML works, but don’t need to be a hands on coder.\n- High G-factor. This role has high uncertainty/fluidity/complexity and we know it will change, sometimes weekly.\n- This is our role with the highest requirements; but if you’re the right candidate, you will have one of the most challenging and exciting roles you could dream off.\n\n\nFor all our roles we ask the following: we want unconventional people. Who solves impossible problems. Who table flips the checkers board when losing “because it’s a stupid game requiring no strategy” and proposes to switch to alpha-go (chess is sooo February 1996). Ideally someone who tries to make up new rules.\n\n\nYou need to have an appetite to work on fundamentally hard problems; a glass-is-overflowing type of person; that laughs at the 9th failed attempt.\nWe want people who grow naturally (professionally and more importantly as human beings), that we can grow, and who can grow us. A+++ but we actually mean it.\n\n\n\nMost important: you need to have a good reason for being here and wanting to work with us.\n\n\nSome must-have requirements. You have/are:\n\n- MD/PhD in neurology.\n- 1:10.000 top communicator.\n- Experience with IP/licencing.\n- You might have moved from Mayo Clinic to Google Health; then a fast riser in companies such as Flatiron, Owkin, Tempus, Prognos, Linguamatics, HortonWorks, IQVIA.\n\n\nPractically speaking You are\n\n- Ideally able to start ASAP. Full time.\n- If you’re good we want you to stay for long (+2y) so this needs to be at least theoretically possible.\n- Available to work with us in person in London regularly - this is important to us to make the team cohesive and in sync.\n- That said, expect to travel a lot. Both within the UK and outside of the UK.\n\n\nWhat we’d love to give you if you join\n\n- This is our role with the highest requirements; but if you’re the right candidate, you will have one of the most challenging and exciting roles you could dream of.\n- This is a Special Ops. role and you’ll be working directly with the CEO to execute on key strategic imperatives.\n- Daily challenges, variety, flexibility.
