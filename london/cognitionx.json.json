  "description": "CognitionX is a global leader in AI and emerging technology. Its mission is to bring clarity to, and accelerate adoption of AI across all organisations from global enterprises to startups, and help ensure a safe and responsible transition to an AI-driven society. The Knowledge Network provides a completely new way of accessing expert advice on AI - that is simple, fast and affordable.\n\nWith AI changing everything and every organisation, companies of all sizes need to form an AI strategy and get on with deployment. But the current options of consultants are expensive and slow, and searching the web for answers immediately becomes a project.\nThe free, public version of the Knowledge Network empowers users to immediately access a global network of AI experts, on-demand, while the Enterprise edition also enables large firms to capitalise on internal expertise.\n\nThe company is headquartered in a vibrant startup accelerator, right in the heart of Soho.",
