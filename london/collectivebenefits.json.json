  "description": "Collective is on a mission to build the safety net for the freelance economy by giving freelancers the benefits, protections and perks of big company employment. \n\nThe way we work is fundamentally changing with freelancers representing a significant and growing market in the UK and abroad. There are currently over 5 million freelancers in the UK, 11 million in the EU and 35 million in the USA.  Whilst freelancing comes with many advantages, it leaves many people underserved with regard to their financial wellness compared to their employed peers.  This protection gap leaves a significant population highly exposed and vulnerable and without the support they need.\n\nWe want to fix this by rebuilding benefits from the ground-up and making them fit for the future of work. This includes developing our own unique suite of innovative insurance products and bringing them together with best in class benefits and perks all in one simple to use digital platform.",
