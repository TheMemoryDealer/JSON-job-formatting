  "description": "Crypto Quantique is a deep technology company that has developed a transformational cybersecurity technology, using the most advanced techniques in cryptography and quantum physics, designed to ensure that device security becomes foundational and end-to-end IoT security becomes standard practice.\n\nFounded by Dr Shahram Mossayebi (CEO, PhD in Post-Quantum Cryptography), Dr Patrick Camilleri (CTO, PhD. Eng) and Kumi Thiruchelvam (CCO, MEng), Crypto Quantique has created the world's first proven quantum driven secure chip design for standard silicon which is coupled to an end to end supporting architecture encompassing cryptographic key and lifecycle management.\n \nTheir ground-breaking technology radically simplifies the process of generating a hardware root of trust in an IoT device, solves the issue of secure onboarding an IoT device in an untrusted environment and plugs the gaping device security hole that currently exists in the IoT ecosystem.\n",
